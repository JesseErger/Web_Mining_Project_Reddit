I am not sure what I&amp;#39;m doing, but I can&amp;#39;t see staying here much longer. I&amp;#39;m stuck and feel so hopeless. More and more is weighing on me every day and I&amp;#39;ve lost everything. I watch as my adult body and partial adult mind revert to childlike mentality and have feelings and emotions of a small child. It&amp;#39;s pathetic. I truly do hate who I&amp;#39;ve become. And I honestly can&amp;#39;t control the PTSD, to others it may seem like an excuse, but I fight it constantly, 24 hours a day and sometimes I just can&amp;#39;t and it gets through in a big way and I spiral out of control. I don&amp;#39;t know.
