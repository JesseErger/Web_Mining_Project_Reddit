I recently broke my \u00a365 headset somewhat by accident after losing my temper. I&amp;#39;m broke right now so can&amp;#39;t even afford a new one. I personally find the only passion I have is playing games, I wish there were other things I enjoyed which I could dedicate my time to. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "name": "t1_crrd44z", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/380smz/i_just_want_the_hurting_to_stop/crrd44z/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1433148875.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1433120075.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "crrctff", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ballast_nt", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_380smz", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Hey, I had a very similar experience growing up, my parents weren't involved much at all, and I was hopelessly addicted to videogames, I couldn't find any ground in the world at all, and it really effected me on a deep level, I had no skills, I couldn't work, I had nothing.\n\nThe one thing which probably saved my life was music and playing music, because there was something about it that really made a huge difference in the people I met and the ability to dedicate myself to something that actually paid off.\n\nNow I'm moving towards sports like baseball, even though I'm out of school now, and I feel exponentially more optimistic about the future - yes, I have cut videogames entirely out of my life, although I don't necessarily see them as absolutely horrible - I think the problem is more that kids who don't have involved parents are getting trapped in them because their parents haven't got the ability to pull them out of the electronic worlds and put them back into reality.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, I had a very similar experience growing up, my parents weren&amp;#39;t involved much at all, and I was hopelessly addicted to videogames, I couldn&amp;#39;t find any ground in the world at all, and it really effected me on a deep level, I had no skills, I couldn&amp;#39;t work, I had nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one thing which probably saved my life was music and playing music, because there was something about it that really made a huge difference in the people I met and the ability to dedicate myself to something that actually paid off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m moving towards sports like baseball, even though I&amp;#39;m out of school now, and I feel exponentially more optimistic about the future - yes, I have cut videogames entirely out of my life, although I don&amp;#39;t necessarily see them as absolutely horrible - I think the problem is more that kids who don&amp;#39;t have involved parents are getting trapped in them because their parents haven&amp;#39;t got the ability to pull them out of the electronic worlds and put them back into reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "name": "t1_crrctff", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/380smz/i_just_want_the_hurting_to_stop/crrctff/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1433148309.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1433119509.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qpzs", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_380smz", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": null, "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qpzs", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_380smz", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "crrd0xh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HoppingTheRocks", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_crrcrq8", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I've always struggled with thinking what I want to do or what I want to become, My dream would probably just to be a comedian of some form, But my anxieties hold me back from even cracking a joke around friends..
