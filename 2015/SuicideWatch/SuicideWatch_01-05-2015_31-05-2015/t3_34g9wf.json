Usually a personal appeal works in these situations if you have a good relationship with the boss in general.  Something like:  &amp;quot;Boss, I know that I screwed up, and I know that have done so in the past.  I want to work on improving so that I can keep contributing to the company, etc. etc. etc.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want you to know that there are always options if you are willing to look for them (even if it means having to ask for help).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: link spacing&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "name": "t1_cque8et", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/34g9wf/too_scared_to_face_tomorrow/cque8et/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1430463595.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1430434795.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}]
