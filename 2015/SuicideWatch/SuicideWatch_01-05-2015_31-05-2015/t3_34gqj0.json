I assume(maybe wrong) that majority of the posts here are motivated by similar events.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything begun around 1st November, last year. I got to know her, and after about 3 weeks we&amp;#39;ve been together. I felt like she was The One. I met many girls before but she was the first one that I have trully fallen in love with. She had a lot of problems, tough childhood, father, who is a drunk, ex-bf who was hating on her (with whom she is in the same class). I wanted to help her, I didn&amp;#39;t even anticipate anything more, I just wanted to help. Everything was great for 3 or 4 months, we knew that we were made for each other. And then everything started to fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She is a shy, troubled person, I was exactly like her a year ago, and I tried to help her, help her get out of comfort zone. She was afraid to make any physical contact when anyone was nearby. Her anxiety got the best out of her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I was too harsh, I think, and things like not wanting to hold my hand, or to hug me started to start fights. Things got out of hand pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like the downfall started on March 10th. She asked if I knew a certain guy, I said that I didn&amp;#39;t, but because I am IT person I quickly stalked the shit out of him, told her about him etc. I asked why did she ask about him. She said that mutual friend gave her his regards(don&amp;#39;t know how accurate is it in english, in my native language it probably sounds better). She then told me that she noticed him looking at her in school. I knew something was off. I talked about it with her and she promised that she will not maintain contact with this person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believed her, I had my doubts, but she has never lied to me, so I had no reason not to trust her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flash forward to 21st April 2015. exectly 5 months after we decided to &amp;quot;be together&amp;quot;. Fights escalated, I always tried to calm everything down. The most memorable moment is that she had troubles with her math class, and I wanted to help so badly, but she said she don&amp;#39;t want to come, I tried to convince her to set the fights aside for a while and think about her future. Just come and try to sort problems out. I took like an hour, she didn&amp;#39;t budge, she wasn&amp;#39;t going to anyway, I knew her character, but I tried anyway, I tried everytime. That was the time she broke up with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 days later she agreed to talk with me. We sorted things out but she said that she doesn&amp;#39;t want anymore relationships. I tried to convince her that everything can be as awesome as it was in the beginning, etc. She didn&amp;#39;t budge, as always. She told me that she still loves me, though. That thought kept me going for few more days. (until today).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the same day we talked on Facebook and everything seemed to be okay, I wanted to give her time and I was certain that everything will go back to normal in no time. Then she stopped responding. She did that a lot before, she just doesn&amp;#39;t pay attention to her phone/fb chat that much, and it&amp;#39;s ok. But something felt wrong. About 9pm I decided to go to her place, I started to worry if she was okay. I sat there for a while and then she came, with a guy I talked about before, ON A MOTORCYCLE. (Sounds like a fucking movie plot, doesn&amp;#39;t it). When she noticed me she didn&amp;#39;t even say a word to the guy, she just followed me. I asked her why did she do such thing, knowing that would hurt me. She said that he is just a friend and stuff. We talked for a while, she told me she hates me, and doesn&amp;#39;t want to see me again. Then he came, and I just left, knowing that all hope is lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started to get cold, after 3 days she tells me that she misses me etc. I start to gain hope again. Everything was on the right track, she seemed like she really did love me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, today happens. I asked her if she wanted to meet today, she said that she cannot today, this was the last message I received. I thought she will be home about 10pm(as always). I went there about 9pm, waited 2 hours. She was no where to be seen. Well, she went out with friends for a night, no big deal, you might think. The problem is she has done that only once in her life. With me... I know she is with the other guy, probably on some party or whatever. What&amp;#39;s killing me is that I know she trusts him at least as much as she trusted me back in the day. I know that I&amp;#39;ve lost her forever, and even though I love her more than anything, I realised my mistakes and I am ready to correct them, I will never be with her again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That thought alone makes me lose all hope. I just want to die, I know that I am probably not going to do this(that&amp;#39;s why I feel like I shouldn&amp;#39;t write here) because I am too much of a coward to take my own life. I had very promising future, I am really good at programming, but now it doesn&amp;#39;t matter for me. I am just happy to get that off my chest.
