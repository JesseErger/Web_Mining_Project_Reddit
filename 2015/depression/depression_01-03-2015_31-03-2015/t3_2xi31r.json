I&amp;#39;ve been in college for almost 4 years now, but am nowhere close to getting a degree. There&amp;#39;s really no way to afford my waffling between majors anymore, but my parents will disown me if I don&amp;#39;t complete college. I was told throughout my life that I am &amp;quot;so smart&amp;quot; and other bullshit like that, but despite putting the effort in, my grades at school are falling and my GPA is practically dead. So there is definite empirical evidence to the contrary. I have almost no job experience to speak of, no references, and nothing I am skilled at. I have no real talents or interests, rather just things to distract me from how much I hate living. Slowly, over the years, I have lost all of my friends. I guess I am not a very fun person to talk to or be around. I remember being told throughout high school that &amp;quot;it gets better&amp;quot;. Clearly not. I know there are people who have it worse, but I don&amp;#39;t see any other outcome for me than as a broke, lonely hermit working at a gas station. Or maybe I&amp;#39;ll just be homeless, since no one seems to like my resume. Or maybe I&amp;#39;ll just starve to death before I even get to that point since I can barely afford food and rent at the same time as it is with my school-provided job. I feel like I&amp;#39;ve ranted too much now. This isn&amp;#39;t a very clear post and I&amp;#39;m not even sure what I want in terms of comments or anything. Maybe just downvote or ignore this post.
