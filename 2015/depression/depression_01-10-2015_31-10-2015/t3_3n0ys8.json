Life was very hard for me growing up. I was the oldest sibling and I came from a broken home. Parents divorced, family always fighting, my little brother went to youth prison. I worked in a market and I had enough money to pay for Doritos and watch arsenal play. I never drank alcohol, I never did anything all I did was fap and watch football. I had no desire or will to do anything and I was dspressed with good reason to be, I had nothing going for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, my life has changed unbelievably. I lost all the weight and ran a major marathon last year. I fell n and I I fell out of love. I made some amazing friendships. I currently attend one of the best (top 30) Universities in the world. I have interned at some amazing companies and I&amp;#39;m being mentored by the former director of Cambridge University. On the social side, I went on holiday with some friends last week, I live with 5 friends and have many friends living close. I like to party and I know how to party hard. I met a stunning girl who I fell for a few days ago. Things are going well with her. My life is honestly an absolute dream. I never imagined this would happen to me. I didn&amp;#39;t plan, it just happened. I never got a big break, I never had a mentor or a family connection. I forced this all to happen through hard work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the thing is I feel so lost and directionless. I feel like that&amp;#39;s it. There&amp;#39;s nothing more I want to do in life. I&amp;#39;ve gotten into an unbelievable position and now I don&amp;#39;t care about anything. I keep thinking back to 3 years ago when I was so overweight and depressed. And I find the internal change so overwhelming. I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on in my head but I feel so fucked up. I&amp;#39;m not stressed over a person or a thing or work or money. I just don&amp;#39;t see the point in anything anymore. I&amp;#39;ve had some very rigouros legal interviews over the past few days and I&amp;#39;ve performed incredibly highly. I&amp;#39;ve been offered a job with a $50k training salary which can rise to $100k a year after 2 years already and I&amp;#39;m only a year into my degree which I&amp;#39;ve rejected because I know I can do better things. (FYI the job is as a lobbyist which is something I morally fundamentally disagree with). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what I want to do with my life. I don&amp;#39;t know where I&amp;#39;m going. I don&amp;#39;t even know how I got to the position I am in. and I know I should be grateful and just keep working but I just keep thinking what, why me, why did I deserve this etc ???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does this make sense at all ? I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on with my brain. I should be euphoric. I just met my mum for the first time in a while and I full on just started crying in her arms. I couldn&amp;#39;t keep it in anymore. I don&amp;#39;t talk about my accomplishments with anyone. I only tell 2 of my friends what I&amp;#39;m doing and I don&amp;#39;t tell them I&amp;#39;m depressed as I don&amp;#39;t want to burden them. they are both incredibly busy young men. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please do not say congrats OP you did so wel or I smell bullshit or anything.
