of these thoughts and I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s the drug That makes me do this or my depression or maybe both but I write in this phone all the time to distract my mind from everything to not feel anything and I lost my train of thought again I don&amp;#39;t know why I do this I am writing to show someone or i want to connect with people but I don&amp;#39;t know how to do it every time I think about doing it there&amp;#39;s something stopping me I&amp;#39;m having too many thoughts to process and I can&amp;#39;t decide which direction to go with it because all of it seems relevant but then I could just stop this and go about my life but then I&amp;#39;m stuck being bored so I choose to explore my thoughts and I want to record them but I&amp;#39;m having too many at once and can&amp;#39;t write at the pace I&amp;#39;m thinking so this is what this is and not only are these thoughts that I&amp;#39;m having but they now exist  where other people can read them and I want that to mean something i want that to mean something I want that to mean something I want that To mean something but it doesn&amp;#39;t mean anything this is who I am and it doesn&amp;#39;t mean anything and I want to express it I want to write so I write my thoughts and my thoughts become why I am writing I&amp;#39;m writing because I want to and that should end my thought process but I want it to continue so it continues into this and in a way it&amp;#39;s beautiful and I just want to get lost in it but I feel like it&amp;#39;s wrong I feel like instead I should listen to a song listen to someone else not think for myself but I always have to think it never stops never ceases and just knowing that naws at me and so I want to express it as if there&amp;#39;s some way that someone could help me but if they can&amp;#39;t they might think I&amp;#39;m crazy and in all honesty I could just ignore it and go back to my life so peacefully but the feeling persists that there&amp;#39;s some purpose to all of this I just don&amp;#39;t know what it is I feel like it&amp;#39;s beautiful to just express and say how I&amp;#39;m feeling so I  can appreciate it it&amp;#39;s crazy I know it is but I just keep doing it and I want to show this to someone and know what they think of it but it&amp;#39;s me theyre judging and I just don&amp;#39;t think I could deal with that and so it continues beautiful and endless and if someone else read it this would become their thoughts I could make this a book but would anyone read it it&amp;#39;s feel empty and meaningless just cuz I made it I can&amp;#39;t tell if there&amp;#39;s value in writing this down But I keep fucking doing it it&amp;#39;s beautiful and endless and possibly pointless but I feel like I&amp;#39;ve achieved something by expressing something even though it&amp;#39;s just mindless rambling it&amp;#39;s just how I think when I&amp;#39;m alone cuz when I&amp;#39;m alone I pull out my phone and I write and I can&amp;#39;t stop writing so I write what I think and it loops endlessly so maybe if I express it someone else knows what it&amp;#39;s like to feel this way and we can feel the same but what does that change and thinking this way make me feel crazy  cuz my thoughts try to rhyme and I say things I don&amp;#39;t mean or even know what they mean so I erase them from the page and forget what I meant to say so I&amp;#39;m just left with this but what would I have if I weren&amp;#39;t recording this a blank fucking page and nothing to say and I feel like That  is beautiful and that should end it but it just keeps going with nothing to say and it feels like this is who I am this is everything I&amp;#39;ll be a magnum opus but it still feels empty why would anyone read this why would anyone care what I think cuz this is all it is and it&amp;#39;s beautiful and endless but I could easily stop it I  could look away from the page and do literally anything but I just keep fucking writing with nothing to say and this whole fucking essay exists and so it should mean something anything but the feeling persists that it&amp;#39;s just fucking empty But there is that feeling when I say fucking in that particular phrase and I want to share it maybe your empathy will let you feel it if you could hear me say it but if I&amp;#39;m showing this to you I wouldn&amp;#39;t know where you are on the page and it would seen out of place and I feel like anyone could think this and write it down so it&amp;#39;s empty and meaningless But I&amp;#39;m the one feeling it I&amp;#39;m the one doing it so that must mean something I guess this is a cry for help I just want to feel meaning and so I think and I think and these are my thoughts and it&amp;#39;s beautiful and endless please someone read this wait no please someone enjoy this someone find meaning in these words that I&amp;#39;m saying i just want to express something anything and so there I find a sort of joy in saying something anything it&amp;#39;s repetitive and means the same thing it just seems stupid when you explain it but it makes it mean more than just saying nothing and I&amp;#39;m out of things to say again But I just keep writing because I just keep thinking and it seems awful repetitive and maybe that should bore me but it keeps spawning different thoughts each time I repeat it so I just keep doing it sometimes throwing in the word fuck just to emphasise that it&amp;#39;s frustrating and that feels gratifying everything comes back to rhyming  and these are my thoughts this is who I am and I feel fucking boring maybe there&amp;#39;s beauty in that but this whole fucking thing seems too long and boring to read so no one will see maybe I&amp;#39;ll ask someone I know to read it just so they see this but what if they don&amp;#39;t like it what if they don&amp;#39;t like who I am cuz after all these are my fucking thoughts and now I feel crazy but I&amp;#39;ll think myself out of it like I always do and say anyone would feel crazy if they were thinking like me do you think that I&amp;#39;m crazy now that you can see that this is how I think when I&amp;#39;m all alone and what does that mean if I&amp;#39;m crazy does it mean anything does it devalue my opinion of things does it make me less of a human being but what if I&amp;#39;m wrong and sometimes other people think like this just maybe  not for as long and so this whole thing has become an experiment to see how far I can go without saying anything and fighting the urge to end it Cuz I know when I end it I have to face it and know that it exists something that holds all my thoughts and everything I am cuz I expressed it so it&amp;#39;s beautiful and endless a constant progression but maybe it&amp;#39;s finally time to end it\nBut upon ending it  I always attempt to reread it and feel embarrassment at what I felt but maybe so would someone else and that makes me less embarrassed but if I&amp;#39;m wrong and this now exists then that&amp;#39;s embarrassing and saying things like that make me feel like words are just a game and I feel like that&amp;#39;s worth sharing but I&amp;#39;d have to share everything raw and uncut just the way it is the way it was when I thought it cuz if you can&amp;#39;t love it all you can&amp;#39;t love it at all it is what it is because of its flaws and I I&amp;#39;d hope someone enjoys it even thought it means nothing but hopefully it&amp;#39;s inspiring to write something with meaning\nSo here we go again into this dreary existence of recording my thought &amp;#39;s and wondering if there&amp;#39;s meaning and I&amp;#39;ve said all this before with different words but that was another instance so there must be a difference in the worth of its existence and saying those words makes me smile but by writing that down I&amp;#39;ve missed an opportunity to continue that game but this is still a game all the same just to see how far you will follow me even though I will never really see only you will know and that in and of itself has no worth but me pointing that out without being there must make you feel weird I could be wrong but regardless your still reading this just stringing you along only spaces separate the words on the page to signify that these are all just words not part of a thought I just happened to arrange them in this way but the same words rearranged could have a completely different meaning though obvious and self defeating I make a point to point it out hoping once again that that gives it meaning does this have any meaning maybe you could tell me but what if I&amp;#39;m not there what if this is found by someone in the future long after my departure that was somehow ensnared by the words on this page well if that were true then they&amp;#39;d be left contemplating everything I&amp;#39;ve said possibly debating meaning or dismissing it as nonsense refusing to let it haunt their existence are they stronger than me simply because they can&amp;#39;t see that everything is meaningless and aren&amp;#39;t miserable simply because they exist but then upon expressing this I&amp;#39;m proud of it and feel it should be shared though it doesn&amp;#39;t have a good feeling just an open ended ending like a Shitty horror   movie that insists it will continue in the future by  the rising of a hand out of a grave or the opening of an eye on a face without a body it&amp;#39;s abstract in its mysteriousness to which I mean the darkness out of which a pair of red eyes can suddenly emerge out of the darkness of your mind because I grouped these words on a page and suddenly all of that is gone when you start reading this words have all the power that I give them and the same may prove to be true for you but I do not pass it off as wisdom it&amp;#39;s to be tested specifically for you to see if it is true such as the pleasure in repetition and suddenly deviating but then again returning to the point from which we deviated to deviate a new into a path entirely new without any new meaning cuz it&amp;#39;s all just a game to see how far I can go when I perfectly well know this is beautiful and endless but I waited longer to repeat it so maybe this time it has more meaning maybe you can feel the beauty of this experience maybe you can stop fight each word and each sentence just wishing I&amp;#39;d end this appreciate what I&amp;#39;ve given maybe  through repetition you could learn to enjoy this and find new hidden meaning each time it&amp;#39;s repeated but who has time for that?
