Ive made huge mistakes that will never leave me and im not even 18 yet. Ive always had problems and no one really noticed and choose to ignore them. I didn&amp;#39;t have a life, i was a outcast, antisocial, confused teenager whos mental ill mum attached herself to. I wanted to change my life so i tried to reconnect with old friends who introduced me to drugs. I started using pot and synthetic cannabis and smoking ciggies heavily. Untill i got kicked out of school for being apart of the supply train for my school when actual i had nothing to do with it. I realised i fucked up and wanted a better life but i was captivated by the first girl to ever show a interest into me. I&amp;#39;m not gonna go into detail cause i cant relive what i did but short story is i corrupted myself and now believe everyone i meet thinks im a pedo. I got let back into the same school after 8 weeks of nothing. Everyone never knew who i was but now the whole school new me as a drugo and fucking creepy cunt. I wanted to kill mysleft for so long and i used what ever i could get my hands off to take away my thoughts. It went on and on untill i could no longer take the stares at school and sitting in class thinking of the fastest way to die. I dropped out which prompted more weed smoking. 4 months of waking up everyday deciding between going to counselling in the morning which i was to disgusted by my actions to talk what was making me ill and just smoke weed in the afternoon or to jump off a building so i could forget.I went to rehab because i was coming to my last strings and once again wondered if it was just the drugs that was putting me down. I went to rehab ,which i found out drugs wernt really the problem but i do have a addictive personalties. anyway i graduated in 7 months and in that whole time never said a word about the real reason why i used drugs. the last 2 months didnt start to make me ill again. As soon as i got out i smoked weed and drank heaps, all thoose promises and dreams gone within 2 months where i got back to the old me. 7 months washed away to where i am now. Im doing a course that when i started it it was easy and as the weeks progressed my life has slowly broken down to the point where all i wanna do is to stop thinking. Im failing a course i should have excelled and you want to know why im writting this all down cause now i crashed my parents car on the motorway into two other cars and i have no money and insurance dosent cover it because i broke the law, but my parents for now think insurance is covering it because i didnt tell them there was another person in the car. I got no friends,no money,no skills,no life, no ambitions and the only people who care about me ive lied to so much and im waiting for them to catch me out on all the lies ive told them since i graduated rehab.
