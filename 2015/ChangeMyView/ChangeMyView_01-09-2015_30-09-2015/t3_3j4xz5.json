My feeling is: they're very, very present in certain circles, and non-existent in others, but they're still common enough that many of us get exposure to it. You may have never encountered it - bless - but I have personally seen it all over Tumblr, a bit on Facebook, and once or twice IRL. \n\nTumblr is known for this (you can see more of the same type of stuff if you browse around at /r/TumblrInAction, where they reference Tumblr users and their abundance of special pronouns / sjw behaviors), and I'm assuming OP's social circle has some pseudo-feminist (/sjw/preteen) types that like to endorse these pronouns. \n\nKeep in mind, /u/flatsperm, if you're googling only 2 of the special pronouns and you only get 10k hits, that's still a decent amount. The fact that zimself/xerself got 10k hits isn't too bad considering how many more are out there. \n\nPronouns are associated with gender, and well, the number of \"special\"/\"non-standard\" genders out there [is very very high](http://i.imgur.com/p4xnW8U.png). Now, of the total global population, of course these extra genders (+ their respective pronoun sets) aren't going to be widely recognized or used in terms of percentage, but they're there for sure, and I've encountered them a few times, especially online. \n\nI concede again that I've only heard it once or twice in real life, but still: I think it's common enough to warrant discussion. Whether it is an \"issue\" or not remains to be seen, but I think the existence of the argument itself is justified, and it's not a definite non-issue.\n\nYou can visit /r/tumblrinaction for more specific examples instead of relying on my anecdotes, but yeah - this pronoun trend is real and pretty common within certain scopes. \n\nAs for my personal stance: if I'm correct in understanding /u/AFCSentinel's argument to mean that she/he/they pronouns are INTENDED to be references to GENDER - a non-descriptive, non-uniquely-identifying category - so the habit of generating a new gender + new pronouns for each quirk/nuance is counter-productive for no more complex of a reason than: \"I can't remember what to fucking call you,\" then I agree. (Wow, what a fucking run on sentence, but it's okay because I haven't had coffee yet.) It's a practical concession. Here's an arbitrary scale: \n\n- For absolute unique specificity, we use ID #'s like social security numbers.\n- One level up, and we use full names, like John Doe.\n- One level up, and we use identifiers with only a few elements per set, like a surname that references a group of 3-4 people - a family.\n- (...)\n- Penultimately, we have gender, which in most (?) cultures serves to categorize the world (more or less) into two halves (or an otherwise small number - the world divided by 4 is still a huge amount of people per set).\n- Finally, we have humanity - the category that holds us all, and therefore, says basically nothing about the type of characters it actually holds.\n\nGender + pronouns are, at least in a practical sense, used as very vague, imprecise descriptors of who we are. If you take a word thats intended to describe half the word and bump up its \"specificity level\" a bunch of ticks to make it refer to only a few people...that's very much an annoying trend - one that is shielded from criticism because gender identity is a touchy topic.

You may have never encountered it - bless - but I have personally seen it all over Tumblr, a bit on Facebook, and once or twice IRL. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tumblr is known for this (you can see more of the same type of stuff if you browse around at &lt;a href=\"/r/TumblrInAction\"&gt;/r/TumblrInAction&lt;/a&gt;, where they reference Tumblr users and their abundance of special pronouns / sjw behaviors), and I&amp;#39;m assuming OP&amp;#39;s social circle has some pseudo-feminist (/sjw/preteen) types that like to endorse these pronouns. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, &lt;a href=\"/u/flatsperm\"&gt;/u/flatsperm&lt;/a&gt;, if you&amp;#39;re googling only 2 of the special pronouns and you only get 10k hits, that&amp;#39;s still a decent amount. The fact that zimself/xerself got 10k hits isn&amp;#39;t too bad considering how many more are out there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pronouns are associated with gender, and well, the number of &amp;quot;special&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;non-standard&amp;quot; genders out there &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/p4xnW8U.png\"&gt;is very very high&lt;/a&gt;. Now, of the total global population, of course these extra genders (+ their respective pronoun sets) aren&amp;#39;t going to be widely recognized or used in terms of percentage, but they&amp;#39;re there for sure, and I&amp;#39;ve encountered them a few times, especially online. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I concede again that I&amp;#39;ve only heard it once or twice in real life, but still: I think it&amp;#39;s common enough to warrant discussion. Whether it is an &amp;quot;issue&amp;quot; or not remains to be seen, but I think the existence of the argument itself is justified, and it&amp;#39;s not a definite non-issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can visit &lt;a href=\"/r/tumblrinaction\"&gt;/r/tumblrinaction&lt;/a&gt; for more specific examples instead of relying on my anecdotes, but yeah - this pronoun trend is real and pretty common within certain scopes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for my personal stance: if I&amp;#39;m correct in understanding &lt;a href=\"/u/AFCSentinel\"&gt;/u/AFCSentinel&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s argument to mean that she/he/they pronouns are INTENDED to be references to GENDER - a non-descriptive, non-uniquely-identifying category - so the habit of generating a new gender + new pronouns for each quirk/nuance is counter-productive for no more complex of a reason than: &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t remember what to fucking call you,&amp;quot; then I agree. (Wow, what a fucking run on sentence, but it&amp;#39;s okay because I haven&amp;#39;t had coffee yet.) It&amp;#39;s a practical concession. Here&amp;#39;s an arbitrary scale: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For absolute unique specificity, we use ID #&amp;#39;s like social security numbers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;One level up, and we use full names, like John Doe.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;One level up, and we use identifiers with only a few elements per set, like a surname that references a group of 3-4 people - a family.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;(...)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Penultimately, we have gender, which in most (?) cultures serves to categorize the world (more or less) into two halves (or an otherwise small number - the world divided by 4 is still a huge amount of people per set).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Finally, we have humanity - the category that holds us all, and therefore, says basically nothing about the type of characters it actually holds.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gender + pronouns are, at least in a practical sense, used as very vague, imprecise descriptors of who we are. If you take a word thats intended to describe half the word and bump up its &amp;quot;specificity level&amp;quot; a bunch of ticks to make it refer to only a few people...that&amp;#39;s very much an annoying trend - one that is shielded from criticism because gender identity is a touchy topic.

No one outside this bubble gives the remotest fuck about any of it -- and for good reason, I think, because one&amp;#39;s use of the fundamental grammatical elements of their language is so automatic and non-conscious that attempting to regulate/police the pronouns other people use in everyday language is unfair just on its own, and doubly so when it&amp;#39;s being backed up by the threat of being publicly accused of bigotry or intolerance, which it often is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I would love seeing someone get an office job among regular folks somewhere and try to explain to all their coworkers that their &amp;quot;preferred pronouns&amp;quot; are different, and why people&amp;#39;s use of pronouns in general should be treated as somehow especially important in a social or political sense. (if it ever happens and gets caught on tape it will probably shoot right to the top of &lt;a href=\"/r/cringe\"&gt;/r/cringe&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I otherwise agree with the points you make. I just don&amp;#39;t think you really have to worry that this is an issue that will be permeating into the wider public consciousness anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cun9j6j", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/3j4xz5/cmv_he_she_they_thats_all_the_pronouns_you_are/cun9j6j/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1441160651.0, "author_flair_text": "1\u2206", "created_utc": 1441131851.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3j4xz5", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cumz7it", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Wh00ligan", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_3j4xz5", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "The English language is fluid.
