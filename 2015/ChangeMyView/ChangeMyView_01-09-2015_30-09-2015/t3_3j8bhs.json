So to recap, Anaconda didn&amp;#39;t get nominated for best video, Nicki went on Twitter and basically said that it didn&amp;#39;t get nominated because she&amp;#39;s a curvy black woman and implied that if she were a skinny white girl like tailor swift (she never said nor implicated tailor, but tailor took it to mean her because she is a good example) she would have been nominated. Miley then says in an interview that she could have respected what Nicki said if it was said in a different less angry way, but couldn&amp;#39;t because of the way she presented her points. She called Nicki &amp;quot;not polite&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;not very nice&amp;quot; in her statements about the nominations. Then during the VMAs Nicki said &amp;quot;back to the bitch that had a lot to say about me in the press a few days ago&amp;quot; then said something along the lines of &amp;quot;what you got.&amp;quot; Miley then said, &amp;quot;we are all in the same industry, we all do interviews, we all know how they manipulate things, congratulations on your award.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly before this incident I respected Nicki way more than Miley, but I&amp;#39;ve lost some respect for Nicki and gained some for Miley.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think Miley&amp;#39;s comments to the press were respectful, articulate, and accurate. I think she handled the VMA situation maturely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think Nicki&amp;#39;s comments on Twitter came across as petty, and I also think they were inaccurate. I think the way she handled the VMAs was immature and only served to detract from her point by diminishing her credibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also feel like Nicki and Beyonc\u00e9 are two strong examples of non white women who are both celebrated for their contributions to the music industry and are regarded widely as extremely sexy. For this reason, I think that people calling it &amp;quot;body shaming&amp;quot; that Nicki wasn&amp;#39;t nominated is ridiculous. She&amp;#39;s a pop star and sex symbol, nobody is body shaming her, and if they are, not nominating her for an award doesn&amp;#39;t count. I also feel like it makes sense that there aren&amp;#39;t as many black women who are famous and receiving awards because, well, there are way fewer black women than black men, white men, white women, and all other gender ethnicity  combinations combined.
