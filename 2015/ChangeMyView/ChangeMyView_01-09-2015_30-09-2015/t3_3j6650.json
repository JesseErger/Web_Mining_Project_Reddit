If you&amp;#39;re of the same school of thought as I and society at large that cheating is wrong, then you or anyone with good moral standing may find being someone&amp;#39;s paramour morally wrong, personally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, one could argue that someone who would make the personal choice to be an illicit lover might not be of good moral standing. That&amp;#39;s fair; thinking that is their own right, and could very well be the case. And, just the same, to your argument&amp;#39;s credit, I reiterate that it is also the paramour&amp;#39;s right to decide whether or not they objectively aid someone in cheating. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I guess I agree with your argument, but also there are valid distinctions you failed to mention that should be made in referencing this moral dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cump6zk", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/3j6650/cmvi_dont_see_anything_wrong_with_sleeping_with/cump6zk/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1441110230.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1441081430.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3j6650", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3j6650", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3j6650", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 2, "name": "t1_cumt1fh", "id": "cumt1fh", "parent_id": "t1_cumpzm4", "depth": 3, "children": ["cumt1fh"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cumpzm4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kabukistar", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cumpv7m", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "You both are.  \n\nThe thing is, with cheating (and relationships in general) it's not that a girl just walks into a bar and announces she's going to sleep with whomever takes her offer first.
