You keep focusing on this aspect:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;the benefits you reap depend, in no small measure, on who gets elected&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While this is clearly true, it is irrelevant.  My argument isn&amp;#39;t that I shouldn&amp;#39;t vote because it doesn&amp;#39;t matter who gets elected or which policies are enacted.  My argument is that I have no reason to vote because my act of voting does not affect who gets elected or which policies are enacted.  I mentioned in another comment the idea of writing what I wish the government to do on a piece of paper, tying it to a balloon, and releasing it into the sky, as an example of something that is about equally likely to effect political change as just the act of my voting.  From my perspective, it sounds like you are telling me not to dismiss the possibility of the balloon strategy because I should care what policies the government has.  I don&amp;#39;t see how those things are related.

Your phrasing here reminded me of another decision problem, [Kavka's Toxin puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavka%27s_toxin_puzzle), which I wonder how you would answer.  Personally I don't think it's psychologically possible to voluntarily believe or disbelieve a single proposition.  You can maybe coach yourself over time to pay attention only to the evidence for something and ignore evidence against, and so by curating a particular strain of confirmation bias, eventually hope to change your belief from what follows rationally from your other beliefs to something else.  But it's not something you can consciously control.  I can't ignore the fact that the 2-box theory dominates, so I can't change the fact that the Predictor would likely predict I am a 2-boxer, maybe not quite so robustly as I would be stuck with the Smoker's Lesion, but still pretty much outside the realm of possibility.
