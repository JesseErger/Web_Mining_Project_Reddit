This is a movement calling attention to the fact that in our modern world - in which many people still think racism is not a pervasive social and cultural issue - black lives and black bodies have been and are considered less important, even worthless. Contrary to the bullshit spouted by people like Bill O'Reilly, this movement is not saying that black lives are worth *more* than any other lives. But All Lives Matter is not an appropriate substitution to Black Lives Matter because this movement is pointing to the plight faced by a specific group of people and emphasizing their worth in particular in the face of ongoing and violent prejudice. Doing so does not lessen or overturn the plight faced by other groups of people, while the concept behind All Lives Matter *does* lessen the plight faced by certain groups of people that do not include privileged racial majorities. \n\nSo, to protected status for gay students. You have to understand that up until very very recently, much of the gay bullying that happened in schools went unpunished. By adding provisions that require schools to prevent the bullying of gay students and punish the bullies who do, for once there is some level of acknowledgment that LBGT students ARE LIKE ALL OF THE OTHER STUDENTS. It's not that they're special, or \"protected\" (in quotes, as you put it), but rather, that their wellbeing is just as important as every other student's wellbeing. Bullying has been something parents, school boards, and legislators have been looking at for decades, especially since Columbine. But gay students have too often been left out of that conversation - they are bullied often at a higher rate than other students, they are often not protected by their schools because of prejudice that even school administrators have toward the LGBT community, and they have a horrifically high rate of suicide due to this bullying. \n\nTo sum it up: just like Black Lives Matter does not negate the reality that all lives do indeed matter, legislation that puts protections in place for LGBT students (from other students, but also from school boards and administrators) does not negate the fact that bullying is bad or that many different kinds of people are bullied in schools. Instead, it simply gives LGBT students - who have historically been bullied at higher rates, with fewer punishments for those who bullied them - the same worth as other bullied students in the eyes of the law.

This is a movement calling attention to the fact that in our modern world - in which many people still think racism is not a pervasive social and cultural issue - black lives and black bodies have been and are considered less important, even worthless. Contrary to the bullshit spouted by people like Bill O&amp;#39;Reilly, this movement is not saying that black lives are worth &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than any other lives. But All Lives Matter is not an appropriate substitution to Black Lives Matter because this movement is pointing to the plight faced by a specific group of people and emphasizing their worth in particular in the face of ongoing and violent prejudice. Doing so does not lessen or overturn the plight faced by other groups of people, while the concept behind All Lives Matter &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; lessen the plight faced by certain groups of people that do not include privileged racial majorities. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, to protected status for gay students. You have to understand that up until very very recently, much of the gay bullying that happened in schools went unpunished. By adding provisions that require schools to prevent the bullying of gay students and punish the bullies who do, for once there is some level of acknowledgment that LBGT students ARE LIKE ALL OF THE OTHER STUDENTS. It&amp;#39;s not that they&amp;#39;re special, or &amp;quot;protected&amp;quot; (in quotes, as you put it), but rather, that their wellbeing is just as important as every other student&amp;#39;s wellbeing.
