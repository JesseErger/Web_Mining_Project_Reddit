I will not give up easily.\nI believe I can change this country, better yet, this world for the better. The whole idea behind what I am about to say relates back to evolution. Humans do not allow evolution to take place properly. We save the weak. I personally believe that we should execute the weak. yes, this sounds harsh but let me explain why. We are not advancing as a race. For now though, we will keep it to America for the sake of the argument and hope the rest of the world catches on. Another massive problem we are facing is over population, we are using our resources and producing waste and pollution and mind blowing rates.\nYou look at animals and if an animal doesn&amp;#39;t want to eat, it dies, if a human doesn&amp;#39;t want to eat, it has an eating disorder and is treated for the disorder. More importantly that human is allowed to procreate. We allow shitty genetics to be passed on. We SAVE the WEAK. We also allow these morbidly obese, incredibly stupid people live and breed. If an animal in the wild isn&amp;#39;t fit, or cannot attract a mate, it will die and or be unable to pass on its genetics. Humans may be fat and physically repulsive but if they have money they can still get women and still have children, which fucks with the gene pool. I could go on for longer in this section but if more reasoning is necessary i&amp;#39;ll continue on later.\nNow to determine who is to be executed. The type of people i want to execute are people who are not able to make a contribution to society. If you weigh 500 pounds but you&amp;#39;re incredibly smart, you can still make a contribution to society. The opposite is also true, if you&amp;#39;re borderline retarded but you&amp;#39;re very physically fit, you can also contribute to society. People who are mentally unstable shall also be executed as we wouldn&amp;#39;t want their genetics passed on and they are a threat to the gene pool we are creating.\nWhat will determine who is executed: At the age of 14 years old, annual testing will begin based on birthday. There will be three tests, a mental test, a physical test, and a psychological test. Your Mental test exactly 3 months after your birthday and your physical test 9 months after your birthday. Tests will vary depending on your age, the older you get the harder they become, until the age of 20 where they will remain the same until 35 and gradually work their way down until the age of 65 where no further testing will be required. At the age of 20 we will also introduce psychological testing which will continue until the age of 65.\nWhat the tests will consist of: The mental test will be a basic evaluation of your ability to do math, your ability to read and write, and your basic understanding of the sciences. This test should not be difficult, anyone who has at least a D average in school should be just fine. For the physical test, every age group will be required to complete a mile in 16 minutes. This is a very easy time to make, you can walk that pace. Physical tests will include varying push up or sit up tests depending on age group. There may be a few other exercises required in certain age groups, and the amount of repetitions will also vary depending on age. this should be easy for anyone who isn&amp;#39;t morbidly obese. Next is the psychological test. These will be administered every 5 years to insure mental stability and health of everyone. We want the mental health of our gene pool to be good as well. Lastly, there will be certain ways to be omitted to testing, ALL WILL BE FROM SOME SORT OF SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY, the main one being in the military. If you served in the military without being dishonorably discharged, you will be exempt from any further testing in your lifetime. Another example of a way to be omitted from testing is by paying for it. The cost will be $25,000 per year, per person. Many will be angry that it&amp;#39;s giving more power to the rich, but i see it as a valid way of determining someones potential for making a contribution to society. If you are rich, I will almost guarantee you are either physically fit enough or mentally fit enough to pass the tests and you would have been fine anyway. AN IMPORTANT NOTE: You will only have to pass 2 out of 3 tests.\nHow we will execute people: We will set up an organization in charge of carrying out testing and executing people. My idea is to possibly have the military be in charge of this, though I haven&amp;#39;t had the time to think too much into that, this I am very open to other ideas on. The method of execution i think will be best is the firing squad. 8 men, 2 with real bullets to ensure death, 6 with blanks for the obvious reason. For those who are unaware, my understanding is that firing squads use primarily blanks so the gunmen aren&amp;#39;t aware of who actually killed the person so they don&amp;#39;t have trouble with living life after killing someone.\nNow another thing i would like to do that isn&amp;#39;t executing people, but will improve our gene pool is preventing certain people from having children. People with MORE THAN two generations of diagnosed cancer or potentially terminal illnesses that tend to be passed on genetically will be sterilized. These people will not be allowed to produce offspring, however we will make it easy for them to adopt if they would like to have children.\nI would also like to place a limit on the amount of children a person may have. The maximum number of children a person may have is 3, which is a very reasonable amount. It should slow the rate of population increase or possibly make the population decrease due to some couples not having children or only having 1 child. There is no reason to have more than 3 children because at that point you&amp;#39;re just putting a burden on society. If say you already have 2 children and you would like to have a third but you end up with twins, triplets, or even more, you will be allowed to keep them as it wasn&amp;#39;t your intent to have that many. When you hit the limit for children you will be sterilized.\nThis is all i can think of for now, if i remember more of my plan i will post. So reddit users, change my view.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "\n_____\n\nAlright, so, i was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion, and while i am open to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely, i will only do so if you can actually change my mind.

Studies actually show that the less competent or knowledgeable or intelligent you are, the less likely that is to be true (sort of like \"the more you know, the more you know you don't know\"). Your other comments say you'd accept the consequences if you didn't pass the tests, so let's move on from that.\n\nNext, your testing requirements seem pretty arbitrary to me, and ignore many of the ways people contribute (or don't) to society. There are plenty of intelligent, sane, physically fit people in this world who don't really contribute. There are also plenty of other traits that we \"should\" be looking for other than your three. An ability to reason well, an ability to convince others of your views/ideas, an ability to lead, an ability to follow, an ability to read other people, humor, work ethic, responsibility, creativity, positivity; I could go on forever. These are all arguably necessary things to society. You can be fat and stupid and still contribute immensely. But how do you test for these? I'd argue that you can't, really.\n\nYou're also underestimating humanity's penchant to take the easy way out. Well, I'm sane and not fat, so I'm set for life. Imagine a world full of people bred from that stock.\n\nThen we come to the arbitrators. Who gets to decide what the standards are for testing? Who, in their infinite wisdom, practicality, fairness, and foresight, gets to decide who lives and dies? I can't think of a single goddamn person I'd want to put it that spot. People are inherently selfish creatures that look to surround themselves with similar people.  Why in God's name would I want anyone in that position to where they might decide that people of \"my kind\" (whatever that may be) are no longer desirable? Let's say we pick some people and make a committee of some sort. Who gets to pick the people on the committee? Don't trust anyone in that position of power either. Everybody? Well, now we're back to general democracy, which I get the feeling you don't like, seeing as how you think some people aren't even fit to live, much less decide how society's going to go.\n\nYou've come up with tests as a supposedly unbiased measure of people's worth, but someone still has to make and evaluate the tests, and suddenly it's not so unbiased anymore. And everyone has biases. Everyone. The thing about a bias is that often, you don't even realize you have one. (Remember your racist grandma or whatever, when she would get called out, and she'd say \"I'm not racist, I'm just telling you the *truth* that everyone else is too afraid to say\"? Well, there's her bias, and she most certainly does not think she has one.)\n\nTL;DR: this system is unfeasible because there is no perfect person that could be responsibly put in a position of so much power.\n\nAnd finally, I'd like to point out that you seem to care very much about the state of the human race in the future. Well, guess what? Lots of people don't. Lots of people couldn't give a rat's ass. They don't think that's very important. So what makes it important enough to override the wishes of everyone else on the subject? You think it is. Why does what you think is important outweigh what I think is important? Because you're more intelligent than me? Well, I think I'm more intelligent than you. Everybody does. Everybody thinks they are a special snowflake, and nobody is actually in a position to evaluate whether they are because of our inherent biases on the subject of ourselves.

An ability to reason well, an ability to convince others of your views/ideas, an ability to lead, an ability to follow, an ability to read other people, humor, work ethic, responsibility, creativity, positivity; I could go on forever. These are all arguably necessary things to society. You can be fat and stupid and still contribute immensely. But how do you test for these? I&amp;#39;d argue that you can&amp;#39;t, really.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re also underestimating humanity&amp;#39;s penchant to take the easy way out. Well, I&amp;#39;m sane and not fat, so I&amp;#39;m set for life. Imagine a world full of people bred from that stock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then we come to the arbitrators. Who gets to decide what the standards are for testing? Who, in their infinite wisdom, practicality, fairness, and foresight, gets to decide who lives and dies? I can&amp;#39;t think of a single goddamn person I&amp;#39;d want to put it that spot. People are inherently selfish creatures that look to surround themselves with similar people.  Why in God&amp;#39;s name would I want anyone in that position to where they might decide that people of &amp;quot;my kind&amp;quot; (whatever that may be) are no longer desirable? Let&amp;#39;s say we pick some people and make a committee of some sort. Who gets to pick the people on the committee? Don&amp;#39;t trust anyone in that position of power either. Everybody? Well, now we&amp;#39;re back to general democracy, which I get the feeling you don&amp;#39;t like, seeing as how you think some people aren&amp;#39;t even fit to live, much less decide how society&amp;#39;s going to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve come up with tests as a supposedly unbiased measure of people&amp;#39;s worth, but someone still has to make and evaluate the tests, and suddenly it&amp;#39;s not so unbiased anymore. And everyone has biases. Everyone. The thing about a bias is that often, you don&amp;#39;t even realize you have one. (Remember your racist grandma or whatever, when she would get called out, and she&amp;#39;d say &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not racist, I&amp;#39;m just telling you the &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; that everyone else is too afraid to say&amp;quot;? Well, there&amp;#39;s her bias, and she most certainly does not think she has one.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: this system is unfeasible because there is no perfect person that could be responsibly put in a position of so much power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And finally, I&amp;#39;d like to point out that you seem to care very much about the state of the human race in the future. Well, guess what? Lots of people don&amp;#39;t. Lots of people couldn&amp;#39;t give a rat&amp;#39;s ass. They don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s very important. So what makes it important enough to override the wishes of everyone else on the subject? You think it is. Why does what you think is important outweigh what I think is important? Because you&amp;#39;re more intelligent than me? Well, I think I&amp;#39;m more intelligent than you. Everybody does. Everybody thinks they are a special snowflake, and nobody is actually in a position to evaluate whether they are because of our inherent biases on the subject of ourselves. And it&amp;#39;s like, man, just like, your opinion, man.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cummkgh", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/3j5b7g/cmv_we_should_execute_the_weak_to_improve_the/cummkgh/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1441105185.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1441076385.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3j5b7g", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "name": "t1_cumj2ix", "id": "cumj2ix", "parent_id": "t1_cumhl4o", "depth": 3, "children": ["cumj2ix"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cumhl4o", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cumhdpw", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": 1441525805.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cumhl4o", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/3j5b7g/cmv_we_should_execute_the_weak_to_improve_the/cumhl4o/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1441096867.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1441068067.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cumhdpw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "VaginalExcrement", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cumgbkg", "score": -3, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "If it was determined that a person like myself was unfit to live, more than 50% would be executed.

The means cannot be separated from the cause, and over time those self-destructive traits will manifest themselves in unintended ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cumg8l1", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/3j5b7g/cmv_we_should_execute_the_weak_to_improve_the/cumg8l1/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1441094616.0, "author_flair_text": "44\u2206", "created_utc": 1441065816.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3j5b7g", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3j5b7g", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3j5b7g", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cuml8mn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Buddha_Clause", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cumh8f9", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "You ever ask that vaginal you excreted out of her thoughts on the matter.
