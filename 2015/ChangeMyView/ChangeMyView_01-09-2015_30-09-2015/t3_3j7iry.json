It changed the game in terms of airports vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prior to 9/11 the assumption was, for the passengers of a hijacked plane, that the hijackers would fly to some third world country, demand a big bag of money, and either free the hostages or be killed when delta or the seals storm the plane.  Either way your best bet was to stay in your seat and keep your head down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the assumption is that you are dead anyways and you either get to die a hero fighting to take down the hijackers, or you somehow manage to save the plane and live (and be a big f-ing hero).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short, thanks to the TSA, and thanks to what 9/11 did to change the landscape, airports are no longer attractive targets for terrorists.
