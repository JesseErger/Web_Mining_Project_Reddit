The definition of a critic is simple: \u201ca person who judges the merits of literary, artistic, or musical works, especially one who does so professionally.\u201d  Now, Christgau certainly does this.  I&amp;#39;m not arguing whether he qualifies as a critic or not, I&amp;#39;m arguing that he is bad at being a critic.  This is because in truth what a good critic does goes beyond that basic definition.  Here are a few of what I see as commonly-agreed-upon methods of good criticism:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They make their opinions on the work clear. This is the easy part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They provide a justification for those opinions, based on the work, so that they are credible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are the most vital two.  As long as you fulfill those requirements you are essentially doing the job of a critic.  Your actual writing may be poor but your criticism is still good.  However, there are a few further elements which, though arguable, also help:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Criticising not the artist, but his art.  That is, you call the music idiotic, but you don&amp;#39;t call the muscians idiots.  Basically, avoid ad-hominem attacks, both because you&amp;#39;re an art critic and not a people critic, and because it&amp;#39;s highly unprofessional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forming your opinions based on what the art is trying to achieve rather than what you desire. I.e. don&amp;#39;t criticize Hamlet for being sad.  It&amp;#39;s a tragedy, and is meant to be sad, so that means it succeeds in what it&amp;#39;s doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistency isn&amp;#39;t required, especially if a critic has a long career like Christgau&amp;#39;s and thus their outlook changes over the years.  However, a critic&amp;#39;s tastes shouldn&amp;#39;t be constantly jumping around or they become unreliable and arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are probably more, but those are the basics, and no matter how many requirements you set up, it ultimately doesn&amp;#39;t matter, because Christgau violates every last one.  To be clear, I&amp;#39;m not saying that all of his reviews violate all of these criteria, but that he fails at least one of them in seemingly every review I&amp;#39;ve seen of his, and that those few reviews in which he doesn&amp;#39;t (I give him the benefit of the doubt and assume they&amp;#39;re out there, because of the enormous breadth of his work and the likelihood that I&amp;#39;ve forgotten the particulars of some that I have read) are so rare as to constitute only a tiny fraction of his critical output.  In short, he fails to be a good critic more often than he succeeds, and is therefore bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, to get onto his actual mistakes (for lack of a better word; many are so flagrant that it&amp;#39;s obvious he deliberately does them).  In no particular order of extremity or \u201cbadness\u201d, here are all of his transgressions that I can think of at the moment:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He frequently insults his subjects and cruelly makes attacks on their personal lives.  Perhaps most famous but also most innocuous is his inexplicable hatred for Jim Morrison, describing him in his review of &lt;a href=\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=The+Doors\"&gt;\u201cVery Best Of the Doors\u201d&lt;/a&gt; as an \u201cass man\u201d, \u201cslimeball\u201d and \u201casshole.\u201d More harsh is in his review of the album &lt;a href=\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=The+Libertines\"&gt;\u201cThe Libertines\u201d&lt;/a&gt; by the Libertines, where he makes fun of Pete Doherty&amp;#39;s drug addictions.  As if that weren&amp;#39;t too far, he does it again in his review of &lt;a href=\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Babyshambles\"&gt;\u201cShotter&amp;#39;s Nation\u201d&lt;/a&gt; by Babyshambles, as well as what may be an attack on Doherty&amp;#39;s romantic life, though it is written so ambiguously that I can&amp;#39;t exactly tell (this is another issue which we&amp;#39;ll reach later).  In a case that doesn&amp;#39;t delve into personal problems, he seems to have a fairly creepy view of Karen O from Yeah Yeah Yeahs, mentioning her &lt;a href=\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Yeah+Yeah+Yeahs\"&gt;\u201cfuck-me persona\u201d, calling her a \u201cdolly\u201d and describing one album as \u201csex...and icy hot\u201d.  But worst of all is his suspicious denial that he wants her for a girlfriend in his review of \u201cShow Your Bones,\u201d&lt;/a&gt; evidently meant to be humourous but coming across as gratuitous.  I&amp;#39;m not pretending Karen O isn&amp;#39;t attractive \u2013 in fact, I agree with him on most of it.  But is it necessary for half your writing about a band to be about how sexy the one female member is?  And at that, he wrote those reviews at the ages of 59 to 71, during which time she was 22 to 34 (forgive me if my math is wrong; the point is it&amp;#39;s damn creepy).  He also can&amp;#39;t resist commenting on &lt;a href=\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Nicki+Minaj\"&gt;Nicki Minaj&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; breasts and butt, which is arguably justified since she actually writes songs on at least one of those subjects, but still leaves a bad taste in one&amp;#39;s mouth. In the absolute worst, most disgustingly tasteless example of this, he praises Ian Curtis for committing suicide in his review of &lt;a href=\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=interpol\"&gt;\u201cTurn On the Bright Lights\u201d&lt;/a&gt; by Interpol (for those out of the loop, when Ian Curtis killed himself, his former bandmates reformed into the band New Order), made all the more unnecessary by the fact that he&amp;#39;s not even reviewing Ian Curtis&amp;#39; music \u2013 he just felt the review needed some kind of offensive flair to generate interest, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His reviews often consist of so much jargon that they are nearly or completely incomprehensible, and even those not containing jargon can be hard or impossible to parse.  Half of these examples appear to be, quite literally, jokes, which is either evidence that he doesn&amp;#39;t respect the people he&amp;#39;s reviewing or he doesn&amp;#39;t respect his job as a critic.  Some examples: his review of &lt;a href=\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=queen\"&gt;\u201cQueen II\u201d&lt;/a&gt; by Queen, which means absolutely nothing and seems to be a lazy attempt to dismiss their style entirely.  This is a case of not making his opinion clear, nor providing a reason for why that opinion is.  Another is his review of &lt;a href=\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=The+Strokes\"&gt;\u201cFirst Impressions of Earth\u201d&lt;/a&gt; by the Strokes, which appears to be an idiom meaning, well, something or other, but is again so unclear that it ultimately communicates nothing.  There&amp;#39;s also the case of his reviews of &lt;a href=\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=The+Fall\"&gt;\u201cExtricate\u201d and \u201cKimble\u201d&lt;/a&gt; by the Fall, the former of which means nothing and the second of which contains no reasoning for its judgment.  There are many more examples of this but I feel these are egregious enough to demonstrate his tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His opinions are often inconsistent.  In his review of the Rolling Stones&amp;#39; &lt;a href=\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=The+Rolling+Stones\"&gt;\u201cExile on Main Street\u201d&lt;/a&gt; he praises the \u201clayers of studio murk\u201d over the singer&amp;#39;s voice and gives it an A+.  It&amp;#39;s pretty clear he thinks that this is the band&amp;#39;s best album.  But in his review of \u201cUndercover\u201d by the same band, one of his first criticisms is that the album is \u201cmurky,\u201d and he concludes it is their worst studio album.  So, is murkiness good or bad?  Not only that, but his review of the Stones&amp;#39; album \u201cSteel Wheels\u201d is a B-, which seems to me like a very middling grade.  Then in his review of &lt;a href=\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Sonic+Youth\"&gt;\u201cThe Eternal\u201d&lt;/a&gt; by Sonic Youth, he calls Steel Wheels \u201cimmortal.\u201d  Isn&amp;#39;t that high praise for a B- when you&amp;#39;ve given them A&amp;#39;s and A+&amp;#39;s before?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christgau sometimes goes so far as to outright not review an artist&amp;#39;s music.  He does this in a negative way with his review of &lt;a href=\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Korn\"&gt;\u201cKorn\u201d&lt;/a&gt; by Korn, which consists of a review of the album&amp;#39;s cover art, an implication that the band members are pedophiles and a pun on their name.  Sure, his point is clear: he hates the band.  But what is it about their music that he hates?  We&amp;#39;ll never know.  I specified that example was negative because he also manages to do this as a form of praise, exemplified with his review of &lt;a href=\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=The+Strokes\"&gt;\u201cThe Modern Age\u201d&lt;/a&gt; by the Strokes, in which he dedicates the start of the review to figuring out which 60s/70s punk band he thinks it sounds like, and when he settles on the Vibrators he spends the rest of the review describing them.  Does Christgau really think somebody reading a review for the Strokes wants to instead read a review of a band two decades older and part of a different genre?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He insults fans of artists he doesn&amp;#39;t like, which is needless to say a very immature move for somebody who is allegedly an esteemed critic.  Was it necessary, in his review of &lt;a href=\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Nick+Cave+%26+the+Bad+Seeds\"&gt;\u201cHenry&amp;#39;s Dream\u201d&lt;/a&gt; by Nick Cave &amp;amp; the Bad Seeds, to call his fans cultists and insult their taste in lyrics?  Whether or not he&amp;#39;s right, he&amp;#39;s supposed to be reviewing the music and not the people who listen to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His ratings often have very poor, arbitrary justifications.  The best example is probably his review of &lt;a href=\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Captain+Beefheart+and+the+Magic+Band\"&gt;\u201cTrust Mask Replica\u201d&lt;/a&gt; by Captain Beefheart, which he says he wants to give an A, but won&amp;#39;t, because it&amp;#39;s \u201cjust too weird.\u201d  What kind of reasoning is that?  Is Christgau really so beholden to others that he can&amp;#39;t even state his true opinions on an album?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, he outright states in his review of &lt;a href=\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Public+Image+Ltd.\"&gt;\u201cFlowers of Romance\u201d&lt;/a&gt; by Public Image Ltd that he doesn&amp;#39;t even like rock music or rock criticism (at the risk of this sounding cheap, maybe that&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s so bad at it).  Perhaps this is ultimately unnecessary, but surely to be a music critic you should have an actual interest, if not a passion, in the music you critique?  I mean, imagine the outrage there would be if Roger Ebert confessed, after winning his Pulitzer Prize, that he thinks the entire medium of film is \u201cboring.\u201d  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell that concludes my issues with Robert Christgau.  In summary: his reviews often state their judgments in an unclear manner.  In those cases when they don&amp;#39;t, the judgments often have little-to-no reasoning to back them up, and are further marred by a variety of problems such as engaging in ad-hominem attacks on both the musicians and their fans.  In this way he fails to fulfill his duties as a critic and is thus bad at his job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello, users of CMV!

Let me try to respond here. Context: I'm an amateur music writer (write for The 405, Sputnikmusic, and now Popmatters), and love Christgau for the most part.\n\nWhat Christgau did, first and foremost, was strip all the navel-gazing and meaningless pretention and art-for-art's-sake from music reviewing. He brought serious, punchy criticism into the realm of popular music, and allowed for level-headed appraisal of music that older critics would have snootily disregarded.\n\nWhat I see you arguing, for the most part, is that he embodies a certain pettiness and sleaziness that's super undesirable in a critic, especially now. I'm not going to deny that in some cases. However, I don't think he's just poking fun at Doherty's drug addictions or Morrison's reputation for the most part - I see it as informing the music he's writing about. When he mentions Doherty's \"powder-sniffing,\" he's doing so in the context of what makes their album great, and when he mentions Morrison's \"slimeball\" nature, he's doing so to explain what either makes the album unenjoyable or great (LA Women, for example).\n\nHere's where I think we diverge: it's impossible to totally separate the art and the artist - i.e. take the art in a total vacuum. This is pretty obvious in extreme examples, obviously - like, it's kinda tough to enjoy the Cosby Show now, and it's tough to listen to Lostprophets now that Ian Watkins has been convicted of pedophilia. However, in subtler cases the artist informs the art as well. This can be negative - try listening to Mark Kozelek's misanthropy without thinking of his general shittiness and occasional misogyny - and positive - would *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy* have been quite so impressive without Kanye's general publicness and loudness?\n\nAnd, obviously, it's possible - I know plenty of people who love Sun Kil Moon regardless of Kozelek's public actions. But not every critic wants to do that. Christgau is going to take the artist along with the art, though I don't think he really ever takes the artist in the art's *stead*, but I think they are impossible to extricate from one another. Occasionally, this is more obscure - the KoRn review, for example - but I think that even in those reviews the tone of the surrounding material almost \"makes\" the music: it's a shitty aesthetic, and that shittiness extends through to the music as well (image above boring \"death-industrial,\" leading to boring and dumb music).\n\nAnd, yeah, occasionally his stuff is unwarranted. His Karen O thing is bad, which is why I think that having someone like Jess Hopper in command of P4K is important (even if I generally dislike her writing and self-importance).

Let me try to respond here. Context: I&amp;#39;m an amateur music writer (write for The 405, Sputnikmusic, and now Popmatters), and love Christgau for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What Christgau did, first and foremost, was strip all the navel-gazing and meaningless pretention and art-for-art&amp;#39;s-sake from music reviewing. He brought serious, punchy criticism into the realm of popular music, and allowed for level-headed appraisal of music that older critics would have snootily disregarded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I see you arguing, for the most part, is that he embodies a certain pettiness and sleaziness that&amp;#39;s super undesirable in a critic, especially now. I&amp;#39;m not going to deny that in some cases. However, I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s just poking fun at Doherty&amp;#39;s drug addictions or Morrison&amp;#39;s reputation for the most part - I see it as informing the music he&amp;#39;s writing about. When he mentions Doherty&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;powder-sniffing,&amp;quot; he&amp;#39;s doing so in the context of what makes their album great, and when he mentions Morrison&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;slimeball&amp;quot; nature, he&amp;#39;s doing so to explain what either makes the album unenjoyable or great (LA Women, for example).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s where I think we diverge: it&amp;#39;s impossible to totally separate the art and the artist - i.e. take the art in a total vacuum. This is pretty obvious in extreme examples, obviously - like, it&amp;#39;s kinda tough to enjoy the Cosby Show now, and it&amp;#39;s tough to listen to Lostprophets now that Ian Watkins has been convicted of pedophilia. However, in subtler cases the artist informs the art as well. This can be negative - try listening to Mark Kozelek&amp;#39;s misanthropy without thinking of his general shittiness and occasional misogyny - and positive - would &lt;em&gt;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; have been quite so impressive without Kanye&amp;#39;s general publicness and loudness?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, obviously, it&amp;#39;s possible - I know plenty of people who love Sun Kil Moon regardless of Kozelek&amp;#39;s public actions. But not every critic wants to do that. Christgau is going to take the artist along with the art, though I don&amp;#39;t think he really ever takes the artist in the art&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;stead&lt;/em&gt;, but I think they are impossible to extricate from one another. Occasionally, this is more obscure - the KoRn review, for example - but I think that even in those reviews the tone of the surrounding material almost &amp;quot;makes&amp;quot; the music: it&amp;#39;s a shitty aesthetic, and that shittiness extends through to the music as well (image above boring &amp;quot;death-industrial,&amp;quot; leading to boring and dumb music).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, yeah, occasionally his stuff is unwarranted. His Karen O thing is bad, which is why I think that having someone like Jess Hopper in command of P4K is important (even if I generally dislike her writing and self-importance). However, he&amp;#39;s a caustic dude in a largely caustic-dude-centric field - I won&amp;#39;t forgive him for his sexism, but I can at least understand where it comes from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, in conclusion: Christgau is great primarily because of how he transformed music writing, especially in how he (IMO) tastefully balances art and artist.
