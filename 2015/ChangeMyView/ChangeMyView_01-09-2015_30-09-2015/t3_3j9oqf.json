Maybe it&amp;#39;s just nostalgia, but I&amp;#39;ve been trying to figure out why I don&amp;#39;t feel compelled any more to really comment, and I think I&amp;#39;ve finally figured it out... CMV feels like it&amp;#39;s slowly becoming the place where everyone racist, sexist, transphobic, xenophobic, etc... come to ask for forgiveness and have their minds changed. And it&amp;#39;s always the same arguments over and over, and its becoming very stale. There&amp;#39;s the occasional casual CMV&amp;#39;s and different topics about religion or philosophy or science, but mostly it seems to be about curing prejudice.\nAs an example, I&amp;#39;m going to scroll back through the last few days of CMV and pick out these stand out threads:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CMV: Anti-discrimination law is discriminatory.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CMV: He, she, they. That&amp;#39;s all the pronouns you are getting.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CMV: About Transgenderism, sincerely please&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CMV: Misrepresentations of the Gender Pay Gap is hurting feminism&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CMV: Not knowing her age should be a defense against statutory rape in some cases.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CMV: How is sex not earned?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CMV: All-White towns are a good idea&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CMV: Black governance is fundamentally a kleptocracy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CMV: White Supremacy cannot be defeated by the Black Community&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CMV: There is no such thing as white privilege&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CMV: I think that the feminist movement was not responsible for freeing women and has been bad for women, men, and especially children.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CMV: Ugly/fat people shouldn&amp;#39;t be diagnosed with BDD (Body Dysmorphic Disorder)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CMV: Laws requiring paid maternity leave, in the absence of also requiring paternity leave, would be harmful to women especially those who don&amp;#39;t want kids&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CMV: White North American Jews have an irrational persecution complex&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CMV: People who want their partner to be monogamous do not deserve relationships&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CMV:I believe the wage gap would be eliminated, or greatly diminished, if women spent less time and energy spending and more time and energy earning.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CMV: Nothing worthwhile has ever come from sub-Saharan Africa.

I don&amp;#39;t think this is something we can necessarily change or do anything about, because these are people with views that want to be changed, but it is something that is making me tired of coming back to check on what&amp;#39;s new in this community, because it&amp;#39;s always the same arguments again and again, and the same losing faith in humanity kinds of views again and again... As far as I can see, about 1/2 or 2/3&amp;#39;s of the posts on CMV seem to be coming from the same angles of &amp;quot;I have this opinion of race/gender/sexuality that I think people judge me for, let me make points that have been reiterated by others a million times before&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like to have a little faith restored in this community, debating is one of my favourite things to do, and this community used to be something I looked forward to checking on all the time.

I think my problem is 2 fold: firstly, there&amp;#39;s a lot of threads that die off, OP doesn&amp;#39;t reply, seems like they never &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to confront their biases, and secondly, there&amp;#39;s so many threads which seem like exact reposts with some rephrasing, and I could easy put &amp;quot;race&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;transgender&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;black&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;gay&amp;quot;, etc... into the searchbar for this sub and find posts with exactly their same points... it gets tiring. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cungig7", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/3j9oqf/cmv_rcmv_seems_to_slowly_be_becoming_make_me_not/cungig7/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1441171238.0, "author_flair_text": "74\u2206", "created_utc": 1441142438.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cung5l8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Helicase21", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_3j9oqf", "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Are you saying it's a bad thing that people are recognizing their biases and trying to change things?\n\nAs an aside, I'd point out that what we probably need for this kind of stuff is a better way to differentiate between people who do actually sincerely hold that view and those who are playing Devil's Advocate to try to just get in an argument for argument's sake.
