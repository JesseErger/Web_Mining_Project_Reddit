I&amp;#39;m not saying its smart to major in something totally separate from what you want to do, but it&amp;#39;s likely that the person from Merrimack college that the guy mentioned earlier with an engineering degree wouldn&amp;#39;t even have a shot at being hired for said job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also not saying I support this notion or like the way it is, but I think its a fact of life. When I walk into a job interview, that person likely has an idea in their head about MIT, and I highly doubt they associate theater with it. When I say MIT everyone automatically jumps to engineering in their head, and people think even a theater major would know a lot about engineering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying that the MIT theater major would do better on the job than the engineering major from a less prestigious school, but I&amp;#39;m saying that I&amp;#39;d rather be in the position coming from a more respected school with a worse major, and I think that situation will result in an easier time getting a job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cvjz73i", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/3n1ddd/cmv_the_most_important_thing_about_a_college/cvjz73i/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1443688989.0, "author_flair_text": "20\u2206", "created_utc": 1443660189.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cvjz09z", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cacheflow", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cvjyt2r", "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt; In that first scenario, I honestly think I'd take the theater arts degree from MIT.
