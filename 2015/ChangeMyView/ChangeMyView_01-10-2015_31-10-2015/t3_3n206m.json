And I admit that there are places in which saying that there is a consensus adds nothing to the conversation/argument but why is it dismissed all the time?\n\n4. A consensus means nothing\n\nSaying that a consensus is nothing is like saying \"the theory of evolution by natural selection isn't true because it's only a theory.\" But the fact that this is a theory implies that there is so much evidence toward this hypothesis that the scientific community has agreed that there is a low likelihood that new evidence will come to light to disprove this hypothesis.

If I feel I need a second opinion, I won't go to a doctor, I'll go to another plumber. I am trusting in the people who know about the subject matter to tell me about it. \n\n6. A scientist studying A won't know about B\n\nOf course, that's why I'm trusting the people studying B when I say that there is a consensus on B. I'm talking about the relevant academics.\n\n7.

Now, in a certain context, I can see how it could (one argues against the consensus and is bring up experiment after experiment and so the other just says &amp;quot;there is a consensus&amp;quot;). In that example, sure, that&amp;#39;s a bit of a dick move but this is not really how the majority of my arguments go. You&amp;#39;re argument also assumes that saying &amp;quot;there is a consensus&amp;quot; is a form of censorship and a way to say that one cannot speak against the consensus. But it&amp;#39;s not. I believe that fighting the consensus is important and vital to why the consensus can be trusted. If there is a group of people--scientists from within their field--opposing the consensus and they have evidence that proves the consensus wrong, the academic community does not simply ignore it. They try to first find flaws in the experiment by looking for errors and by doing the experiment again and again. If the evidence is strong enough, the consensus will change. This is why I believe the consensus argument should hold impact, because the academic community is designed to change when new evidence comes to light. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cvk9f4j", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/3n206m/cmv_the_argument_there_is_a_large_consensus_in/cvk9f4j/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1443710346.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1443681546.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "name": "t1_cvk9d8v", "id": "cvk9d8v", "parent_id": "t1_cvk98qw", "depth": 1, "children": ["cvk9d8v"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cvk98qw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Goodthink84", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_3n206m", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Making a point about a scientific consensus is used, in my experience, almost exclusively to accuse one's opponent of being \"anti-science.\" It is not a valid point when used in this way as a ad hominem attack.
