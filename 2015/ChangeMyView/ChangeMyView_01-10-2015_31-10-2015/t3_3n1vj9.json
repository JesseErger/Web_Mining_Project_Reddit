In Picasso's case, we have to listen to what he says his art is about, because it's so very personal. \n\nThis is similar to James Joyce, one of my favourite authors. His books are so very personal and well-constructed that you have to listen to what he says about his work. In fact, you get something like Finnegan's Wake, which is almost created as a direct response to \"death of the author\" thinking because it's so obtuse that it almost purposefully denies meaning and analysis.

Using more T-Swizzle, Shake It Off is so blatant in its lyrics that the only real interpretation is to see it as Swift basically saying \"fuck the haters.\" I'm sure you could come up with a crazy off the wall theory about what it's \"really\" about, but I'd think that 99% of the rest of the audience would disagree with your alternate analysis, and that other 1% is a guy named Bob who spends his weekends at the Home Depot sniffing paint thinner. I'm not calling Swift's music bad - I'm calling it simple, and it's very possible for simple art to be very well constructed (hello Mr Rothko) .\n\nOn the other hand, academia is all about creating and defending New contexts for works. And we have to acknowledge that the work itself has an Aura, that can change and develop over time.
