This Quora post was pretty spot-on:\n\nWhen I was learning to deal with this very same thing years [close friend being distant] ago I one day saw myself in my mind's eye on a jetty. I was with friends and we were chatting. A friend of mine was out at sea and was obviously persistently sailing off the edge of my life. I simply turned around and looked out to where he was. Raised my glass as a salute, paused a moment then returned to carry on the conversation with my friends. This was one of those things that helped me to accept the way things were, not to struggle or be clingy. \n\nsource: http://www.quora.com/How-do-I-come-to-terms-with-a-close-friend-completely-ignoring-me-and-trying-to-keep-me-away\n\n&gt; I believe people should respect that and shouldn't take it personally and weaken the relationship.\n\nRelationships come from familiarity, contact, commonalities.

If the friendship is very old and close, not meeting each other often enough shouldn't kill it. For example, my mom has three best friends. One of them lives in the same city yet they meet about one in two months because they're very busy. Another lives in a city about 3 hours drive away. They meet once a year or less. Another lives in a city about 1 hour drive but often goes abroad so they meet like every two years. Yet whenever they meet, all three of them, you'd think they last saw each other only yesterday. They just pick up right where they left it. However, they all went to medical school together and used to spend a lot of time together when they were young. Now they're all in their late 40s and the friendship is still going strong, but partially because they spent so much time together when they were young.\n\nHowever, I don't think it would work with less close friends. My mom was very lucky to have several close friendships that last a lifetime. I'm 20 and most of my friendships don't last more than a couple of years. When I was in elementary school, I had a few very close friends. However, then I moved out of the district and even though we promised each other to stay in touch and were really close, gradually we just drifted apart. I made a few new friends at school, but lost them when I went to Denmark for an exchange year abroad. In Denmark I made a couple of super close friends. I thought we would definitely stay in touch afterwards. We did... for about a year. Then gradually we drifted apart too. And it was like that with all my friendships except one. I moved to another country to study at uni and I still chat with my best friend from back home on facebook every day. Yet I've only been there for about 6 months... *knocks on wood*\n\nSo I think it's different for all people. Especially for young people nowadays, there's so much socialization, we meet so many people that it's difficult to maintain even the closest friendships when you're not seeing the people.

If the friendship is very old and close, not meeting each other often enough shouldn&amp;#39;t kill it. For example, my mom has three best friends. One of them lives in the same city yet they meet about one in two months because they&amp;#39;re very busy. Another lives in a city about 3 hours drive away. They meet once a year or less. Another lives in a city about 1 hour drive but often goes abroad so they meet like every two years. Yet whenever they meet, all three of them, you&amp;#39;d think they last saw each other only yesterday. They just pick up right where they left it. However, they all went to medical school together and used to spend a lot of time together when they were young. Now they&amp;#39;re all in their late 40s and the friendship is still going strong, but partially because they spent so much time together when they were young.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I don&amp;#39;t think it would work with less close friends. My mom was very lucky to have several close friendships that last a lifetime. I&amp;#39;m 20 and most of my friendships don&amp;#39;t last more than a couple of years. When I was in elementary school, I had a few very close friends.
