I understand it is being addressed by some feminists, but I feel that it being addressed side by side from a male perspective, for male prisoners, is going to offer a huge range of benefits.\n\n&gt;The fact that men are on average physically stronger than women is nothing to deny, but using generalizations is useful only on a population level, because as soon as you get closer, they start falling apart from counter examples.\n\nAbsolutely. I'm a fairly large guy (comments that come my way regularly sound like 'here comes the beast', or 'hey big guy').  I'm sure this aspect has had ramifications on how I view the world, and how others view myself. \n\nWhen I worked retail, only men staffed the warehouse. Many times, female staff would come to me in order to pick something heavy up, or move something heavy around. There was a very very clear gender divide between the 'physical jobs' (warehouse, backyard) and the 'non-physical' (cashiers, help-desk). I'd wager that many people have similar anecdotes, but I'm aware of how little it contributes to the wider discussion.\n\n&gt;I think that's a fantastic idea. I don't see why that would have to be separate from feminism, though.\n\nI can think of a few reasons, although I'm not sure of their strength. I think it would be beneficial for men to have their *own* space, for their issues and their problems alone to be discussed. I think there may be some issue of animosity towards feminism from this group, and there might be some good justification for that, if we're talking about men's issues being neglected by feminism, but still being told by feminism that men's issues are covered by feminism.\n\n&gt;lf. Is there any reason the conversation would need to be gendered? As in, is there any reason the discussion of those issues should focus on just men and not both men and women?\n\nI'm aware of women's increasing role in military - but the military is still very much a 'male' sphere.

I understand it is being addressed by some feminists, but I feel that it being addressed side by side from a male perspective, for male prisoners, is going to offer a huge range of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The fact that men are on average physically stronger than women is nothing to deny, but using generalizations is useful only on a population level, because as soon as you get closer, they start falling apart from counter examples.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. I&amp;#39;m a fairly large guy (comments that come my way regularly sound like &amp;#39;here comes the beast&amp;#39;, or &amp;#39;hey big guy&amp;#39;).  I&amp;#39;m sure this aspect has had ramifications on how I view the world, and how others view myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I worked retail, only men staffed the warehouse. Many times, female staff would come to me in order to pick something heavy up, or move something heavy around. There was a very very clear gender divide between the &amp;#39;physical jobs&amp;#39; (warehouse, backyard) and the &amp;#39;non-physical&amp;#39; (cashiers, help-desk). I&amp;#39;d wager that many people have similar anecdotes, but I&amp;#39;m aware of how little it contributes to the wider discussion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;#39;s a fantastic idea. I don&amp;#39;t see why that would have to be separate from feminism, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can think of a few reasons, although I&amp;#39;m not sure of their strength. I think it would be beneficial for men to have their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; space, for their issues and their problems alone to be discussed. I think there may be some issue of animosity towards feminism from this group, and there might be some good justification for that, if we&amp;#39;re talking about men&amp;#39;s issues being neglected by feminism, but still being told by feminism that men&amp;#39;s issues are covered by feminism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;lf. Is there any reason the conversation would need to be gendered? As in, is there any reason the discussion of those issues should focus on just men and not both men and women?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m aware of women&amp;#39;s increasing role in military - but the military is still very much a &amp;#39;male&amp;#39; sphere. I think the military is apt because it is really a sort of magnifying glass for a lot of the issues discussed; violence, mental illness, masculinity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cp0yadl", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/2xk11d/cmv_feminism_isnt_the_answer_for_men/cp0yadl/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1425260290.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1425231490.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 6, "name": "t1_cp123pc", "id": "cp123pc", "parent_id": "t1_cp0wr7n", "depth": 3, "children": ["cp123pc", "cp0zeys"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cp0wr7n", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "thatoneguy54", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cp0w8eo", "score": 33, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I really appreciate your open-mindedness and civility in this CMV, thanks for being awesome.

There are range of issues holding men back because they are men, and having a group or movement studying why, and how, and how it can be changed and fixed in relation to men, in my mind, is something that can only help the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like this post is going to be a little controversial, so I&amp;#39;d like to say now I&amp;#39;m not stating in anyway what men and women &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be, or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cp0xx3w", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/2xk11d/cmv_feminism_isnt_the_answer_for_men/cp0xx3w/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1425259568.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1425230768.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 83, "name": "t1_cp0xmo3", "id": "cp0xmo3", "parent_id": "t1_cp0woz6", "depth": 3, "children": ["cp0xmo3", "cp0zbtg", "cp0ybvr"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cp0woz6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ildri4", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cp0w8eo", "score": 33, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt;  For one thing, this view completely ignores what happened beforehand for the man to be in trial, the life he had and the experiences he went through.\n\nI think she touches on those pretty well elsewhere though, such as in the section on homelessness, and in discussing the ideas of masculinity in our culture.\n\n&gt;  If all you mean by this is telling men, 'you don't have to be this way', then by all means that's fine.\n\nIn my experience, feminism is about telling everyone that they can be any way- regardless of gender.

Feminism, especially Third Wave feminism, is all about tearing down traditional gender roles, something that can only help women *and* men. I'll go through the issues you raised as being more important to men and show how it's an issue that feminism is actually fighting against right now.\n\n* Prison rates\n\nWhy are men so disproportionately thrown into prison? Well, part of it is a toxic idea that men are more hardy than women. Judges and juries may subconsciously be easier on women when sentencing because they are a woman, and so need extra help or protection. They see men as strong and women as weak, men as aware and accountable for their actions and women as little kids who didn't fully comprehend what they were doing. Feminism hates all of those ideas. By making it accepted that women are not the \"weaker\" sex and bringing the genders to true equality in the eyes of the law and society, rates of incarceration should even out. Really, this idea is central to a lot of other points you brought up.\n\n*Violence\n\nI assume you mean homicide rates being significantly higher for men. This again stems from a toxic masculinity that permeates our culture. Think about the quintessential man portrayed on TV or in movies. He would fight for his woman's honor, isn't a coward and so would fight for his own honor or dignity, isn't afraid to do what he needs to do to get by, even if that includes violence. Some people argue that men are more violent by nature, but I completely disagree. Domestic violence affects men just as much as it affects women, but again, we have this poisonous idea that men are strong and women are weak, so society ignores every instance of a counter-example to that. If we can help destroy these ideas that men are strong, physical, aggressive beings, we can help eliminate violence by raising more non-violent children by showing them that they don't need to prove their worth through fighting, which is silly.\n\n* Homelessness\n\nThis basically touches on the same things as the prison one. Men outnumber women in homelessness quite a bit, and it's partly because we see men as the more competent sex and women as the weaker ones. So if a woman is out on the street, we worry for her safety, we think she's just down on her luck, we think she may have been mistreated by a man. She gets extra help from charities through women-only shelters, or gets more sympathy from others because she's more willing to ask for help. If a man gets put on the street, society sees him as a failure, he's someone who could not pay his bills or hold down a job, he probably does drugs or something. He's also less likely to ask for help because that would be a sign of weakness or admitting he's failed. Tear down the idea that a man's worth is tied to his economic success and we can start seeing homelessness as a serious problem instead of an inevitability.\n\n* Homosexuality\n\nI guess I don't see how this affects men more. Lesbians are routinely discriminated against just as much as gay men are. Could you elaborate here?\n\n* Law\n\nSee prison rates above.\n\n* Sexuality\n\nThis is a really interesting one to me. Think about women exploring their sexualities. It's usually totally kosher, as far as society is concerned. There are \"Lesbians until graduation\" and countless examples of women experimenting in the media. But find any instance of a straight man doing *anything* with another man and it will either be some shameful secret of his or a sign that he's actually completely, 100% gay. This one drop rule comes from our modern definition of manliness, which is basically just a negative. A masculine man is not feminine. You can't be a true man if you act anything like a woman, including exploring our sexuality. So we get straight guys who are curious about the same sex and they mentally kill themselves over it, thinking they're secretly gay instead of just thinking they're a normal human being. And bisexual men are still much more stigmatized than bisexual women. If you look through a list of any out bi celebrities, the vast majority will be women, because it's not yet acceptable for a man to sit somewhere in the middle of the Kinsey scale.\n\n* Sexual crime\n\nThink about the culture we're in, the one that says that men are absolute pigs re: sex. That every man will want sex at the drop of a hat, that it's ALWAYS on his mind, that he will do literally anything just to get laid. The idea absolutely saturates television and movies. With ideas like that, it's not surprising that things like male rape are ignored. Men can't be raped, they want sex all the time! If these shitty gender roles didn't exist, we'd see quite clearly that men are more than just sex-seeking automatons and women are these dour creatures who deign to provide sex to their more primal partners. \n\n* Fatherhood and fatherless homes\n\nWomen are by default seen as the caregivers. I've heard plenty of people say that mothers are better parents than fathers. It's a ludicrous idea, of course, but it's a prevalent one tied to the gender roles in our society. If men are seen as just as competent parents as women, they won't be stigmatized for being single fathers. And if we can instill the idea that men can be just as good of parents as mothers, then perhaps the rate of single mothers would drop.\n\n* Depression and suicide\n\nMen are stigmatized for seeking out help. They're supposed to be strong, work things out for themselves, and, worst of all, not feel emotions. So a man is depressed? He just needs to figure that shit out. We also still have stigmas against mental illness and therapists. Someone with a mental illness is crazy, and anyone who needs to see a therapist is on their last limb, instead of just someone who needs the help of a doctor. But if we can help men express their emotions better, maybe we won't have as many cases of untreated depression which can lead to suicide. If we help men realize that asking for help is not a sign of failure and that they're allowed to ask for help, maybe there will be fewer suicides. \n\n* Transgenderism\n\nLike homosexuality, this doesn't strike me at all as a men's-only issue. Care to elaborate?\n\n* Circumcision \n\nI'm pretty confident that most feminists are against circumcision. They probably don't directly advocate against it, but they are still probably mostly of the opinion that genital mutilation is bad. This is probably one that I think is sincerely a men's-only issue.\n\n* Soldiers\n\nDo you mean that men have to sign up for the draft and women don't? Feminists oppose the draft at all. Do you mean that more men are in the front lines than women? Feminists want to let women do what they want in the military, including fighting on the front lines.\n\n*Mental illness\n\nSee depression above. \n\n* Cultural and societal norms\n\nSee like, everything above. If you're referring to gender roles, you've already acknowledged that feminism seeks to tear those down.\n\n* Masculinity and how it's defined\n\nThis ties into gender roles as well. Feminism does focus on femininity, because it's a movement for women, but it doesn't ignore men either, especially when there are men in the movement. As I said above, masculinity right now is kind of a negative as far as it's defined. A masculine man is not weak, he is not emotional, he does not care about his appearance, etc. A better definition of masculinity needs to come out, and it should come from men, but I don't see why it has to be something that arises separate from feminism.\n\nThat's really the crux of all of this. You said yourself that Third Wave feminism emphasizes intersectionality. Well, men are part of that. There's no reason men can't help solve their own issues (which are related to feminist issues) within the realm of feminist ideals.\n\nAnd as for your entertainment sites, they're just that. If you have a problem with how they're portraying feminism, send them an e-mail explaining why, stop visiting their site, and find one that's more in-line with your ideas.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;we live in shared societies, and issues that affect one will have affects on the other&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think this is really the crux of the issue. Feminism, especially Third Wave feminism, is all about tearing down traditional gender roles, something that can only help women &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; men. I&amp;#39;ll go through the issues you raised as being more important to men and show how it&amp;#39;s an issue that feminism is actually fighting against right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prison rates&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why are men so disproportionately thrown into prison? Well, part of it is a toxic idea that men are more hardy than women. Judges and juries may subconsciously be easier on women when sentencing because they are a woman, and so need extra help or protection. They see men as strong and women as weak, men as aware and accountable for their actions and women as little kids who didn&amp;#39;t fully comprehend what they were doing. Feminism hates all of those ideas. By making it accepted that women are not the &amp;quot;weaker&amp;quot; sex and bringing the genders to true equality in the eyes of the law and society, rates of incarceration should even out. Really, this idea is central to a lot of other points you brought up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Violence&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I assume you mean homicide rates being significantly higher for men. This again stems from a toxic masculinity that permeates our culture. Think about the quintessential man portrayed on TV or in movies. He would fight for his woman&amp;#39;s honor, isn&amp;#39;t a coward and so would fight for his own honor or dignity, isn&amp;#39;t afraid to do what he needs to do to get by, even if that includes violence. Some people argue that men are more violent by nature, but I completely disagree. Domestic violence affects men just as much as it affects women, but again, we have this poisonous idea that men are strong and women are weak, so society ignores every instance of a counter-example to that. If we can help destroy these ideas that men are strong, physical, aggressive beings, we can help eliminate violence by raising more non-violent children by showing them that they don&amp;#39;t need to prove their worth through fighting, which is silly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Homelessness&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This basically touches on the same things as the prison one. Men outnumber women in homelessness quite a bit, and it&amp;#39;s partly because we see men as the more competent sex and women as the weaker ones. So if a woman is out on the street, we worry for her safety, we think she&amp;#39;s just down on her luck, we think she may have been mistreated by a man. She gets extra help from charities through women-only shelters, or gets more sympathy from others because she&amp;#39;s more willing to ask for help. If a man gets put on the street, society sees him as a failure, he&amp;#39;s someone who could not pay his bills or hold down a job, he probably does drugs or something. He&amp;#39;s also less likely to ask for help because that would be a sign of weakness or admitting he&amp;#39;s failed. Tear down the idea that a man&amp;#39;s worth is tied to his economic success and we can start seeing homelessness as a serious problem instead of an inevitability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Homosexuality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I don&amp;#39;t see how this affects men more. Lesbians are routinely discriminated against just as much as gay men are. Could you elaborate here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Law&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See prison rates above.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sexuality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a really interesting one to me. Think about women exploring their sexualities. It&amp;#39;s usually totally kosher, as far as society is concerned. There are &amp;quot;Lesbians until graduation&amp;quot; and countless examples of women experimenting in the media. But find any instance of a straight man doing &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; with another man and it will either be some shameful secret of his or a sign that he&amp;#39;s actually completely, 100% gay.

I&amp;#39;m in my phone, but if someone wants to call me out on one or all of them I&amp;#39;ll post two blog posts on each topic in question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So while advocates for women aren&amp;#39;t obligated to help men as a group, many in fact do and on a much bigger scale than, say, gay rights groups help black people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But if I were to be a transgender/homosexual/minority/victimized/divorced-father-fighting-to-see-his-children/depressed/suicidal/traumatized man, how exactly am I meant to believe that statement when men&amp;#39;s issues are so widely mocked?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As someone in two of those groups I don&amp;#39;t see how mocking a group that is often clownish at best and misogynistic at worst would send me that message. This is especially true given the massive amount if homophobia in the MRM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For examples, check out &lt;a href=\"/r/therealmisandry\"&gt;/r/therealmisandry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://wehuntedthemammoth.com/?s=Homophobia&amp;amp;submit=Search\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Quick note: The large majority of custody cases are worked out outside the court system. The large majority of those that aren&amp;#39;t are decided on a gender neutral basis, namely whoever did most of the child care during the marriage gets custody after the marriage. This is because the kid benefits from the situation changing as little as possible.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In close, there&amp;#39;s a difference between mocking men who are suffering and mocking the men&amp;#39;s rights movement that often just pretends to care about those men. If you care about those men, the MRM isn&amp;#39;t for you. But if you join the anti-circumsision movement; or Just Detention International; or a group fighting against the criminalization of black men, Latino men, and men with mental illness, I&amp;#39;m 100% behind you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cp0uylg", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/2xk11d/cmv_feminism_isnt_the_answer_for_men/cp0uylg/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1425253309.0, "author_flair_text": "1\u2206", "created_utc": 1425224509.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 1, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_2xk11d", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 10, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_2xk11d", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_2xk11d", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 5, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_2xk11d", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 2, "name": "t1_cp0zuye", "id": "cp0zuye", "parent_id": "t1_cp0z3nl", "depth": 4, "children": ["cp0zuye"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cp0z3nl", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "retro_texual", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cp0y8kx", "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt;I wonder to what extent you feel the current incarnation of the MRA fulfills these needs as you describe them?

It has been valuable to me to read about their perspective, to learn about challenges men face that I never knew about. But firstly: I don't see why there should be a competition between feminism and men's rights, instead of the two coexisting and intertwining (which would require an effort from both groups), and secondly, I firmly believe that feminisms focus on femininity can offer a very constructive approach to many of the issues discussed by men's rights, not only pointing out the issues, but also giving an idea of HOW things need to change.\n\nIn most of human history, women have been considered inferior to men. The fact that anyone can be convinced that the ideas and notions developed over thousands of years can simply be reversed within a couple of decades is beyond me. If I couldn't see any gender issues stemming from this history, I would assume to be wrong, and take a closer look.\n\nAnother idea I oppose to, however, is that these problems and issues are being maintained by men, to the disadvantage of women. Many feminists seem to hold this idea, and I disagree. The problems are societal, being upheld by both men and women, to the disadvantage of both men and women. I am upholding them myself; having grown up in this gender-skewed society. And I am consciously making an effort of breaking out of this pattern.\n\nIt is awful that  men has to feel like they are default rapists. It is awful that men being raped is considered something to be made fun of. These issues can very well be embodied by females laughing at the male rape victim - meaning it is something women do to men. I still believe this scenario is based on the subconscious idea that woman is the weaker sex, and that sex is a gift she gives to the man, serving him. It is something he takes from her. I, for one, recognize this subconscious pattern in myself: if I see lots of men having sex with one woman, I see a bunch of men taking advantage of her. If I see a man having sex with a bunch of women, I see a man being served by the women. I subconsciously turn the situation to make  the females weak and passive, and the males strong and assertive. This need to stop. I am not shifting blame: the victim in the above scenario is still the male rape victim, and the perpetrators are still the women making fun of him. If you really want to look at the underlying issue, however, you need to take a look at societie's tendency to devalue what we consider to be feminine.\n\nI think one of our main problems today is exactly this. We have made categories of the feminine and the masculine, and tend to devalue the feminine as being more silly, irrational, and reserved for women, while women can proudly enter the territory of what is considered the masculine.\nIt's as simple as this: women can wear pants, men cannot wear dresses. It's cool for women to watch action movies, it is somewhat embarrassing for men to enjoy romantic comedies. A female boxer is socially accepted, a male belly dancer is not.

The feminine is constantly seen as acceptable for women only, being off-limit, embarrassing, degrading territory for a man to venture into. This is no more my boyfriend's fault than it is mine, and he is at no less of a disadvantage than I am. Feminism has helped me become aware of a lot of issues men face today, has encouraged me to do an effort to improve myself and my views when it comes to these issues, and it helps me see solutions as  well as issues. It has offered me more nuanced and interesting approaches to the problems discussed in men's rights groups than what men's rights have offered - though this could definitely be because I didn't spend enough time reading about men's rights.

It has been valuable to me to read about their perspective, to learn about challenges men face that I never knew about. But firstly: I don&amp;#39;t see why there should be a competition between feminism and men&amp;#39;s rights, instead of the two coexisting and intertwining (which would require an effort from both groups), and secondly, I firmly believe that feminisms focus on femininity can offer a very constructive approach to many of the issues discussed by men&amp;#39;s rights, not only pointing out the issues, but also giving an idea of HOW things need to change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In most of human history, women have been considered inferior to men. The fact that anyone can be convinced that the ideas and notions developed over thousands of years can simply be reversed within a couple of decades is beyond me.

Many feminists seem to hold this idea, and I disagree. The problems are societal, being upheld by both men and women, to the disadvantage of both men and women.

The opposite of a man is a boy, the opposite of a woman is a girl. When certain things are designated as inferior AND female only that is harmful to men, and forbids them from being full human beings. By destigmatizing female things, that makes it easier to then break down the barrier that allows men and women to fluidly cross into formerly forbidden or taboo things.\n\nFor example, when men are told (what i think is incredibly rude and condescendingly) to 'man up' or 'be a man' or 'what are you a girl?' it implies that women and all that is feminine is shameful, and thus they should avoid all things related to femininity. So men end up suppressing emotions or acting violently, doing stupid things to prove their masculinity, breaking their backs to provide for fully capable partners as a matter of pride rather than a matter of love, shamed from decorating their bodies via fashion etc etc. As soon as these things are destigmatized and viewed as positive or acceptable, it is no longer a nightmare to have some 'feminine' qualities or interests-- it allows the man to be liberated to do as he chooses as well, because there is no shame in the feminine.... if that makes any sense.\n\nBecause feminism is a long game, its really about changing societal attitudes, but not just attitudes about women, but its about attitudes between how men and women relate, and their respective places in soceity. When men and women are seen equal the emphasis should be on the equality, meaning it goes both ways.

The opposite of a man is a boy, the opposite of a woman is a girl. When certain things are designated as inferior AND female only that is harmful to men, and forbids them from being full human beings. By destigmatizing female things, that makes it easier to then break down the barrier that allows men and women to fluidly cross into formerly forbidden or taboo things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, when men are told (what i think is incredibly rude and condescendingly) to &amp;#39;man up&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;be a man&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;what are you a girl?&amp;#39; it implies that women and all that is feminine is shameful, and thus they should avoid all things related to femininity.

I would say that feminism can benefit men, but that feminism is neither necessary nor sufficient to solving mens issues.\n\nThat being said, I see benefits and problems with feminism. As a benefit, feminism does often talk about mens issues (in certain circles) and masculinity within the context of a patriarchal society, and claims that by defeating patriarchal standards, not only women are freed from gender expectations, but so too are men. What's more, broad social issues that affect both genders (including socioeconomic and race issues) are also goals of intersectional feminism, and often do include a male component to analysis. Black activism, for example, has components that intersect with feminist theory (black feminism), as well as masculine theory (pertaining especially to incarceration of black men in disproportionate numbers, harassment from police, perception of being dangerous). Depending on the context, feminists are more likely to talk about black womens issues first, but in the right context (such as in the recent Black Lives Matter protests), the treatment of black men become the prevailing narrative.\n\nOf course, there are problems with feminism. My main beef I have with it is that I have a beef with ideological camps to begin with. I perceive the descriptive reasoning behind the feminist concept of 'patriarchy' to be too all-encompassing, don't believe in the end-result of feminism being a gender discrimination-free society, and see extremism within feminism to be a major problem for inter-gender dialogue. All of these problems are analogous to the general ideological problems of descriptive theory, utopianism, and radicalism. With feminism itself, I have a problem with many of the approaches to reasoning and argument, and the focus on women specifically, which can make men feel alienated and left out of the discussion of their own gender issues. Feminism quite often focuses on the importance of experiences and quite often uses rhetorical argument and emotional appeal to argue the existence of patriarchy, or the problems with some social institution. I do believe experiences are important, but experiences come with a strong bias, particularly when the bias involves a notion of oppression. People have a tendency to appeal to a narrative to improve their perceived validity, and often times no one checks their own exaggerations, nor the exaggerations of others. This is especially a problem in feminism; recent reports of false rape accusations result from the standpoint that \"we ought to listen to the victims\", which presumes that experiences matter more than evidence, and that without evidence, we ought to assume a person is a victim if they say they are.\n\nSo, I would say that feminism can still benefit you as a man, although it helps to be critical of it at times. I wouldn't say that men should have equal footing in feminism with women, as it is a women-focused movement, but if feminists want to validly claim that they want to help men through fighting gender stereotypes and standards, they need to recognize that the experiences of men matter just as much as the experiences of women, and that where mens issues need to be challenged, men need to be there to provide context, experience, and solutions, just as women are required in feminism to do the same for womens issues.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feminism should certainly not be the only way we look at gender issues, but it is still an important way to look at gender issues (particularly through the eyes of women, who are disproportionately affected by sexism) when combined with other methods of thought.
