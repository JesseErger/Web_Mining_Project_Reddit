If not, the person with the least votes is kicked out of the running, and everyone who voted for them gets to vote someone else. Repeat until someone has more than half the votes.

In FPTP, there is a strong incentive for parties with similar views to merge, until there are only 2 parties left. In STV there is not. There are other systems that also don&amp;#39;t tend towards a 2 party system, but those systems fail on one of the first 2 points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) It eliminates strategic voting.

This one especially: \"If every voter's preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group's preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged (even if voters' preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and Z, or Z and W change).\" Seems pretty unusual. If a 10% of people within a group prefer X &gt; Y &gt; Z, then Z says something that causes them to change their mind so that Z &gt; X &gt; Y, and in the process somehow change the group preference from X &gt; Y &gt; Z to Z &gt; Y &gt; X I don't see how that is a significant negative. The winner still reflects the wishes of the people.\n\nEdit: essentially, if the system is a single winner system, why should we care about the group preference among non-winners? Or, is there a situation where every voters preference between X and Y remains unchanged but the group's winner changes from X to Y? That would be bad (but not worse than FPTP)\n\n&gt; There are really any incentives to 'merge' in a FPTP system. Instead there are selection and bandwagon effects that drive most parties to marginal support. Most of these effects still exist which is why most governments with STV have a small number of major parties.\n\nIt sure seems like there is to me. I'm familiar with US and Canadian politics, so I'll use examples from there. There have a been a few times in our history where coalitions were formed, which are the first steps to a merger. There is also the fact that people who would rather run as an independent decide to join a party instead, like a micro merger.\n\n&gt; Big tent parties are actually pretty good at incorporating a variety of views and interest groups. People think that the number of parties is related to the diversity of political ideas but in practice that's not really true. If you look at the United States (one of the very few genuinely two-party systems) then you see what are probably the two most diverse political parties in existence. There is massive difference between, for example, Jon Huntsman and Rick Perry, or between Joe Manchin and Elizabeth Warren. Instead of reducing the number of ideas or policy options available to the electorate two-party systems just shift where these discussions occur (intra- instead of inter-party) and when (primary season as well as general election time). Smaller parties in multi-party systems are less capable of accommodating these sorts of differences simply because its necessitates a level of compromise that puts the support of their smaller and more cohesive constituency at risk to another party (see: Conservatives losing support to UKIP or early 2000s German CDU to the FDP).\n\nDiverse views within the party only really matters if its uncommon to toe the party line. I can't find any data on how common this is in the US vs. Canada unfortunately. Also I don't see discussion happening primarily internally to the party as a good thing.\n\n&gt; There are a number of different ways to close a deficit; some are better than others and some are preferred by one party rather than the other.

I do get your point though.\n\n&gt; Accountability: The problem above are compounded by the fact that it's extremely difficult for the public to hold parties accountable for this behaviour. This is because every party can offer a different, plausible, framing of the negotiations and you can usually persuade your supporters which, in a multi-party system, is all you need. And if one party offers any concession than that can be used to 'reframe' what a reasonable compromise is. Further, no party is necessarily being inherently obstinate or obstructionist. Each party has it's own solution and can present itself as a constructive participant in negotiations.\n\nUnfortunately I don't follow you. There are multiple things here I don't understand: why do parties only need to convince the people that already support them in a multi party system? What do you mean by 'reframing' what a reasonable compromise is, and how does that lead to bad policy?\n\n&gt; Firstly it is an effectively bicameral system (its second house is actually willing to disagree with the lower one and is setup to make divided government more likely). Secondly, filibusters create a system of permanent de facto minority government (similar to multi-party systems). What this means is that American political parties can be effectively obstructionist which is unusual for two-party systems (or even two-party plus systems like Canada) and makes it function like a multi-party system. And, in fact, American politics over the last decade or so demonstrate almost everything I described above.\n\nI wouldn't exactly hold up the American system as a shining beacon of what the best political systems can do. I agree with your points about how the details of the American system make it function more like a multi-party systems, which makes it better... but this supports my view.", "edited": 1425203737.0, "author_flair_css_class": "points ", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is pretty relevant.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I don&amp;#39;t understand why I should care about this. This one especially: &amp;quot;If every voter&amp;#39;s preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group&amp;#39;s preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged (even if voters&amp;#39; preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and Z, or Z and W change).&amp;quot; Seems pretty unusual. If a 10% of people within a group prefer X &amp;gt; Y &amp;gt; Z, then Z says something that causes them to change their mind so that Z &amp;gt; X &amp;gt; Y, and in the process somehow change the group preference from X &amp;gt; Y &amp;gt; Z to Z &amp;gt; Y &amp;gt; X I don&amp;#39;t see how that is a significant negative. The winner still reflects the wishes of the people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: essentially, if the system is a single winner system, why should we care about the group preference among non-winners? Or, is there a situation where every voters preference between X and Y remains unchanged but the group&amp;#39;s winner changes from X to Y? That would be bad (but not worse than FPTP)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are really any incentives to &amp;#39;merge&amp;#39; in a FPTP system.

I&amp;#39;m familiar with US and Canadian politics, so I&amp;#39;ll use examples from there. There have a been a few times in our history where coalitions were formed, which are the first steps to a merger. There is also the fact that people who would rather run as an independent decide to join a party instead, like a micro merger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Big tent parties are actually pretty good at incorporating a variety of views and interest groups. People think that the number of parties is related to the diversity of political ideas but in practice that&amp;#39;s not really true. If you look at the United States (one of the very few genuinely two-party systems) then you see what are probably the two most diverse political parties in existence. There is massive difference between, for example, Jon Huntsman and Rick Perry, or between Joe Manchin and Elizabeth Warren. Instead of reducing the number of ideas or policy options available to the electorate two-party systems just shift where these discussions occur (intra- instead of inter-party) and when (primary season as well as general election time). Smaller parties in multi-party systems are less capable of accommodating these sorts of differences simply because its necessitates a level of compromise that puts the support of their smaller and more cohesive constituency at risk to another party (see: Conservatives losing support to UKIP or early 2000s German CDU to the FDP).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Diverse views within the party only really matters if its uncommon to toe the party line.

It can be very difficult to hold multi-party governments to account and, for that reason, it can be difficult for multi-party governments to govern. In order to understand why you need to think of government as being mostly about problem solving rather than pure policy making. Consider budgetary policy. It isn't put forward in a vacuum but in the context of a *problem*, specifically the deficit. There are a number of different ways to close a deficit; some are better than others and some are preferred by one party rather than the other. Most are better than inaction because the deficit, like most political problems, gets worse as time passes. In a two-party system it is possible for a party to chose a solution by using internal selection mechanisms (which are usually effective). In multi-party systems parties need to interact with each other. Each usually strongly prefers its own solutions and strongly dislikes the other party's. Here's where things get messy: at any given moment the cost of a marginal delay is small compared to the cost of compromising (and losing all or most of your preferred policy). So parties tend to delay/not compromise. This pattern continues and those small delays and small costs add up and sooner or later they end up worse off than they would have been if they'd offered maximal concession initially.\n\n* Accountability: The problem above are compounded by the fact that it's *extremely* difficult for the public to hold parties accountable for this behaviour. This is because every party can offer a different, plausible, framing of the negotiations and you can usually persuade your supporters which, in a multi-party system, is all you need.
