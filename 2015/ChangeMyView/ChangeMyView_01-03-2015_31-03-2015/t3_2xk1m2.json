It's a great question but you need to narrow it down and break it up into several sub questions. Climate change is a broad field so you need to ask \"What will happen in regards to subtopic X over duration of time Y, and what are the recommended management strategies for dealing with negative impacts of topic X?\" \n\nSo you could pick any topic. What will happen in regards to the introduction of Salt cedar in the Americas over the next hundred years? If we can't successfully control them then we will see a loss of native riparian tree and animal species, more saline soils and a new type of riparian ecosystem in the american west. \n\n&gt;You mention \"things getting worse\". How so?\n\nAgain, loads and loads of examples we could go through. I'll just pick a random climate change issue. The introduction of invasive species of fungi that causes white nose syndrome in bats and has led to a massive decline in bat species in North America. Essentially, this is fucking up food webs. Insects that the bats used to eat have lost a predator. Many bats actually eat a lot of agricultural pest species so it is conceivable that this will lead to us needing to work on better pest management strategies and improve upon certain pesticides. Will this lead to a collapse of modern agriculture? Nah. Maybe a few crops will be more expensive on certain years when pests are worse (we've actually got a lot of climate change related issues with ag pests) but we're not talking like $500 for a potato. And no I don't see a massive collapse that will lead to everyone needing to work 80 hours a week to farm their own food. There are lots of other interesting issues with agricultural and climate change that we could spend *hours* talking about but none of them end with \"And then everybody died.\" or \"And then we all lived in a horrible post apocalyptic war-zone until the proletariat rose up against the tyrants that took advantage of a collapsed society.\" \nThat is science fiction. \n\n\n  &gt;Will the industrialized world be mostly shielded while the Third World suffers?\n\nWell, maybe not like in a sci fi film but this already kind of happened. There are serious drought issues in central Africa today because industrialized nations halfway across the globe cut down forests for lumber. It turns out, those forests played an integral role in global water cycling and we disrupted it. They used to produce evaporated water that became clouds through transpiration (When a leaf takes in CO2 it lets a little water escape and an entire forest canopy can function like a cloud generator.) and without them the clouds that would have traveled to Africa and precipitated rain just simply aren't there anymore. Major negative consequences that you can already see happening today. But again it's bad but it isn't sci fi level bad. There are programs and researchers working on sustainable agriculture techniques given the new climate. People will and are struggling but they won't be wiped out. Major bummer though I would agree. \n\n\n&gt;What ARE the consequences then?\n\nSo many. So variable. My prediction is that the biggest issue will be when it finally gets to the point that the negative feedbacks of certain things we do (use of fossil fuels, poor management of freshwater, ect) make that behavior economically unfeasible. It will force companies to divert all their remaining energy and resources to finding cleaner alternative energy based ways of doing business. Electric cars, and whatnot.

It&amp;#39;s a great question but you need to narrow it down and break it up into several sub questions. Climate change is a broad field so you need to ask &amp;quot;What will happen in regards to subtopic X over duration of time Y, and what are the recommended management strategies for dealing with negative impacts of topic X?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you could pick any topic. What will happen in regards to the introduction of Salt cedar in the Americas over the next hundred years? If we can&amp;#39;t successfully control them then we will see a loss of native riparian tree and animal species, more saline soils and a new type of riparian ecosystem in the american west. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You mention &amp;quot;things getting worse&amp;quot;. How so?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, loads and loads of examples we could go through. I&amp;#39;ll just pick a random climate change issue. The introduction of invasive species of fungi that causes white nose syndrome in bats and has led to a massive decline in bat species in North America. Essentially, this is fucking up food webs. Insects that the bats used to eat have lost a predator. Many bats actually eat a lot of agricultural pest species so it is conceivable that this will lead to us needing to work on better pest management strategies and improve upon certain pesticides. Will this lead to a collapse of modern agriculture? Nah. Maybe a few crops will be more expensive on certain years when pests are worse (we&amp;#39;ve actually got a lot of climate change related issues with ag pests) but we&amp;#39;re not talking like $500 for a potato. And no I don&amp;#39;t see a massive collapse that will lead to everyone needing to work 80 hours a week to farm their own food. There are lots of other interesting issues with agricultural and climate change that we could spend &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt; talking about but none of them end with &amp;quot;And then everybody died.&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;And then we all lived in a horrible post apocalyptic war-zone until the proletariat rose up against the tyrants that took advantage of a collapsed society.&amp;quot; \nThat is science fiction. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Will the industrialized world be mostly shielded while the Third World suffers?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe not like in a sci fi film but this already kind of happened. There are serious drought issues in central Africa today because industrialized nations halfway across the globe cut down forests for lumber. It turns out, those forests played an integral role in global water cycling and we disrupted it. They used to produce evaporated water that became clouds through transpiration (When a leaf takes in CO2 it lets a little water escape and an entire forest canopy can function like a cloud generator.) and without them the clouds that would have traveled to Africa and precipitated rain just simply aren&amp;#39;t there anymore. Major negative consequences that you can already see happening today. But again it&amp;#39;s bad but it isn&amp;#39;t sci fi level bad. There are programs and researchers working on sustainable agriculture techniques given the new climate. People will and are struggling but they won&amp;#39;t be wiped out. Major bummer though I would agree. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What ARE the consequences then?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So many. So variable. My prediction is that the biggest issue will be when it finally gets to the point that the negative feedbacks of certain things we do (use of fossil fuels, poor management of freshwater, ect) make that behavior economically unfeasible. It will force companies to divert all their remaining energy and resources to finding cleaner alternative energy based ways of doing business.
