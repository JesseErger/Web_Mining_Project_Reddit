Here's the math:\n\n- There are 70 violent people, of which 40 (57%) are black. Hence, *given that a person is violent, the odds are higher than they are black than white. This is the sort of narrative you might get from media exposure.\n- The odds that a black person is violent is 4% (40 of 1000). The odds that a white person is violent is 6% (30 of 500). This means, if you see a white person walking down the street they are 1.5 times more likely to attack you than if it is a black person (6% vs 4%).\n- Overall there is only a 4.67% chance of anyone attacking you (70 of 1500).\n\nDo you see the difference? Now I'm not suggesting this is the case; but just be clear on the difference between the two formulations of probability: \"Given X is true, what are the odds they are Y\" vs \"Given they are Y, what are the odds X is true?\"\n\n**In reality there are more white people than black people, so you might say this is backwards.
