There&amp;#39;s not really a hard and fast line here, but I want to propose a definition of a sport and see what people think of it. If you can convince me that my definition of a sport is significantly flawed, I will award a delta.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my mind, there are three key components to the definition of a sport. First, a sport directly requires physical exertion &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; (not and) physical dexterity or ability. Second, it must be competitive. Third, the scoring cannot be determined entirely by the will of the judges (i.e., what constitutes a tally toward the number which will determine who won and lost must be clearly defined and not open to interpretation).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To elaborate on the first (and probably most controversial) point, to me, all sports are games, but not all games are sports. An activity that is a game but not a sport might lack the requisite physical exertion or ability. Chess is a good example (I say this as an enthusiastic, if very bad, chess player). I know some international bodies see chess as a sport, but it isn&amp;#39;t. While at the top level it requires a decent measure of physical fitness, that physical fitness is never directly called upon, but rather exists only to prevent the body from failing the mind, so to speak; the intense concentration necessary to play a chess match is tiring for both mind and body. However, this does not make chess a sport, because concentration so intense that it requires physical fitness is required to perform many tasks, but that doesn&amp;#39;t make them sports.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Related to this point is the idea that sports require their participants to be in some measure of physical shape to perform well, which I reject. For example, billiards and darts are sports, but you can be quite fat and still play well. This is because billiards and darts require physical skill (the ability to manipulate the cue stick in such a way that it strikes the cue ball in the way you want it to requires a good bit of practice with manipulating objects in physical space, for example), but not physical exertion, which is why I mentioned this distinction earlier. This also means that golf, as much as I loathe it, is a sport.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second point is probably the easiest to explain. If there&amp;#39;s no possible way to determine a winner and loser, it&amp;#39;s not a sport, but merely an activity. Note that just because it&amp;#39;s possible to play &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; determining a winner does not disqualify an activity from being considered a sport by this definition; just because you can play soccer without keeping score does mean that soccer in general is not a sport.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third, scoring has to be objective. For example, in soccer, a goal is scored when the ball completely crosses the goal line within the frame of the goal. The referee cannot dispute this. Of course, he might make the wrong call, but with maximum information (basically goal line technology) it is possible to determine whether or not a goal was scored every time, with no room for interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bring this point up because I don&amp;#39;t think activities like rhythmic gymnastics or ice skating are sports. They are obviously competitive, and they obviously require physical exertion, but the scoring system is too subjective. While I trust judges to know the difference between a good ice skating routine and a bad one, the very fact that in high-level competition there are several judges of equal importance belies the fact that there is at least some subjectivity in the scoring (if there wasn&amp;#39;t, multiple judges would be redundant). This means that these activities are more akin to art than to sports.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, to touch on e-sports. Competitive gaming, as I will refer to it from here on out, is not a sport because it requires next to no physical exertion or ability. It&amp;#39;s obviously competitive and there is a very clear winner and loser, but the competitors are sitting in a chair throughout the competition. Having no legs would not hinder one&amp;#39;s ability to compete in this activity at all. Furthermore, the game does not take place in &amp;quot;real life&amp;quot; (if you wanted to you could write a library worth of philosophy books about what is and is not real life and why, but I think you get what I&amp;#39;m saying) in that the entire game takes place virtually, rather than in the physical, 3D world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While many of the top players of games like Starcraft, LOL and DOTA are quite physically impressive, with excellent reaction times and co-ordination, they don&amp;#39;t use those physical \ncapabilities to manipulate any object or their own bodies in physical space. This means the fact that the entire game is played with a keyboard and mouse makes it not a sport. You can say that the players are dexterous with the mouse, but they are using it to click on things which don&amp;#39;t actually exist. Players in competitive gaming are usually &lt;em&gt;controlling&lt;/em&gt; a virtual character who may or may not be playing what would otherwise be considered a sport; however, the actual human being playing the game is not the character, and is not playing a sport.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: A sport a) requires participants to make direct use of physical exertion/dexterity/ability; b) is competitive; and c) can be scored objectively.

The scoring bit doesn't have to do with e-sports anyways so I'll toss that one for this discussion (because these games have clear rules on victory conditions).  As for the the second one, that pretty much applies directly to video games so I'll toss that out as well.  So as for your definition, the only point of debate is the first one.  We seem to agree so far.\n\nSo here's the problem with the first one.  As per your own definition if it's a sport it must \"directly require physical exertion ***or*** (not and) ***physical dexterity*** or ability.  I have a hard time seeing how manipulating a keyboard and mouse, precisely, with lightning reflexes doesn't count as \"physical dexterity\".  You even say it yourself:\n\n&gt; many of the top players of games like Starcraft, LOL and DOTA are quite ***physically*** impressive, with excellent reaction times and co-ordination\n\nI don't see how you can take that statement and throw it out with: \n\n&gt; they don't use those physical capabilities to manipulate any object or their own bodies in physical space\n\nBut they are.  A keyboard and mouse are physical objects that are being manipulated in physical space.  You need to control *with extreme precision, accuracy, and speed* these physical objects in order to attain the results your looking for.  You, in your own words, even called it a \"physically impressive\" feat.  So where's the disconnect?  How is controlling an object with great physical precision and dexterity not qualify under your first rule?\n\nHere are examples of things that people consider sport, that only require manipulating a \"controller\" to attain some goal:\n\n - Car/boat/plane racing\n - Billiards\n - Hunting/Fishing\n - R/C Sports\n - [Orienteering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orienteering) \n\nAll of these things require mostly endurance and dexterity, both of which are required for e-sports.  The only difference is that the controller you're handling is controlling a physical object rather than a virtual one.  So I would have to challenge you to reason why these would be counted as sports, while e-sports don't count, even though the 'player' goes through the same stresses.\n\nI think this is also a big problem with your argument:\n\n&gt; Chess is a good example ... I know some international bodies see chess as a sport, but it isn't\n\nWell, this is basically opinion.  If the [International Olympic Committee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_sports#Recognized_international_federations) classifies Chess as a sport, then I'm not really sure you've got much of a leg to stand on here.  And even here you're doubling back on your own statements:\n\n&gt; the intense concentration necessary to play a chess match is tiring for both mind and body. However, this does not make chess a sport, because concentration so intense that it requires physical fitness is required to perform many tasks, but that doesn't make them sports\n\nSo you agree that it requires physical discipline to be a top-tier chess player.  But then say that just because it requires physical fitness doesn't mean it makes it a sport and your rational is because other things that require concentration aren't sports.  But Chess ***is*** a sport, because by your own definition of a sport it meets all three criteria:  Requires physical discipline, is competitive, has clear victory conditions.  So no, *other* things that require concentration might not be sports (like taking a test) because they aren't competitive or have \"victory conditions\" but that doesn't mean that Chess isn't since it fills all three of your criteria.\n\nTL;DR - E-sports fits all your criteria of a sport.  You seem like you're agreeing, but convince yourself out of it for kind of unexplained reasons.", "edited": 1422814866.0, "author_flair_css_class": " points", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with Webster&amp;#39;s definition of &lt;a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sport\"&gt;Sport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;a contest or game in which people do certain physical activities according to a specific set of rules and compete against each other&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;a physical activity (such as hunting, fishing, running, swimming, etc.) that is done for enjoyment&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Compare that to yours:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; directly requires physical exertion or (not and) physical dexterity or ability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; it must be competitive&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; the scoring cannot be determined entirely by the will of the judges (i.e., what constitutes a tally toward the number which will determine who won and lost must be clearly defined and not open to interpretation)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your definition agrees with Webster&amp;#39;s definition except for scoring.
