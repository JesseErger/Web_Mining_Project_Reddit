But, if a vegan came to your pig roast and told you that you were *literally guilty of committing another Holocaust*, you would recoil, even though an abstract definition could be interpreted to mean what he/she is saying. That  dictionary definition of the term \"holocaust\" just wouldn't be very meaningful divorced from its historical meaning and the dynamics it evokes within us. \"Holocaust\" is a powerful term not because of the image of a roasted animal, but because of in our minds we associate \"Holocaust\" with the image of the systematic imprisonment and execution of six million Jewish civilians in service of a twisted theory of racial superiority. Even if we used \"Holocaust\" today to mean a \"massacre\", it would feel weird - Adam Lanza didn't commit a \"Holocaust\". Hell, even the 9/11 bombers didn't commit a \"Holocaust.\" Regardless of the dictionary definition of the term, we know that the \"Holocaust\" was a Very Bad Thing that involved a certain dynamic on a certain scale, and attempts to force-fit other things into the emotional reaction that we have to the Holocaust is either a deliberate cheapening of the Holocaust or an attempt to manipulate our emotions into equating something that isn't of the same type or scale with something that we know to be Very Bad.  This is why I personally find the use of the term \"silent Holocaust\" to be really gross and manipulative (and I actually have a Jewish friend whose parents have used the term to describe her potential marriage to a non-Jew).  \n\nSimilarly, the reason debates over the meaning of \"racism\" are so heated is because we all know that \"racism\" is a Very Bad Thing. It evokes the spectre in our intuitions of systematic oppression. When we think of the word \"racism\", we have an emotional reaction that is linked to our knowledge of things like slavery, lynchings, segregation, and eugenics. Regardless of what an etymological breakdown might say, we know that racism is a Very Bad Thing because racism is about *oppression*. When we think of the word \"racism\", we know that it's laughable to apply that term to things like, say, affirmative action - I don't care if you can bend over backwards to find a way to make affirmative action seem logically \"racist\" by some abstract definition, you're going to face pushback from people who think it's incredibly manipulative to analogize a program designed to remedy centuries of oppression to those same oppressive policies.\n\nUsing racism in a way that is divorced from power dynamics either cheapens the term, or is an attempt to be emotionally manipulative.  If you are using the term \"racism\" to describe black people in America who believe that white people are inferior to black people and should be subjugated to them, then fine, I think you can call that racism without sounding crazy.  But the people who describe affirmative action as racism, or who say the Black Lives Matter movement is racist because it focuses on black lives rather than \"all lives\" *are* trying to cash in on the emotional weight that \"racism\" holds in the United States precisely in order to avoid confronting a lengthy ugly history that continues in many forms today, and continues to have significant effects today.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": " points", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve made the argument elsewhere that the definition of racism as simply discrimination on the basis of race actually &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; consistent with what dictionaries generally say.

Even if we used &amp;quot;Holocaust&amp;quot; today to mean a &amp;quot;massacre&amp;quot;, it would feel weird - Adam Lanza didn&amp;#39;t commit a &amp;quot;Holocaust&amp;quot;. Hell, even the 9/11 bombers didn&amp;#39;t commit a &amp;quot;Holocaust.&amp;quot; Regardless of the dictionary definition of the term, we know that the &amp;quot;Holocaust&amp;quot; was a Very Bad Thing that involved a certain dynamic on a certain scale, and attempts to force-fit other things into the emotional reaction that we have to the Holocaust is either a deliberate cheapening of the Holocaust or an attempt to manipulate our emotions into equating something that isn&amp;#39;t of the same type or scale with something that we know to be Very Bad.  This is why I personally find the use of the term &amp;quot;silent Holocaust&amp;quot; to be really gross and manipulative (and I actually have a Jewish friend whose parents have used the term to describe her potential marriage to a non-Jew).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the reason debates over the meaning of &amp;quot;racism&amp;quot; are so heated is because we all know that &amp;quot;racism&amp;quot; is a Very Bad Thing. It evokes the spectre in our intuitions of systematic oppression. When we think of the word &amp;quot;racism&amp;quot;, we have an emotional reaction that is linked to our knowledge of things like slavery, lynchings, segregation, and eugenics. Regardless of what an etymological breakdown might say, we know that racism is a Very Bad Thing because racism is about &lt;em&gt;oppression&lt;/em&gt;. When we think of the word &amp;quot;racism&amp;quot;, we know that it&amp;#39;s laughable to apply that term to things like, say, affirmative action - I don&amp;#39;t care if you can bend over backwards to find a way to make affirmative action seem logically &amp;quot;racist&amp;quot; by some abstract definition, you&amp;#39;re going to face pushback from people who think it&amp;#39;s incredibly manipulative to analogize a program designed to remedy centuries of oppression to those same oppressive policies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using racism in a way that is divorced from power dynamics either cheapens the term, or is an attempt to be emotionally manipulative.  If you are using the term &amp;quot;racism&amp;quot; to describe black people in America who believe that white people are inferior to black people and should be subjugated to them, then fine, I think you can call that racism without sounding crazy.  But the people who describe affirmative action as racism, or who say the Black Lives Matter movement is racist because it focuses on black lives rather than &amp;quot;all lives&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; trying to cash in on the emotional weight that &amp;quot;racism&amp;quot; holds in the United States precisely in order to avoid confronting a lengthy ugly history that continues in many forms today, and continues to have significant effects today.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cxj2tf8", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/3uxy9e/cmv_the_argument_of_whether_or_not_you_can_be/cxj2tf8/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1449006062.0, "author_flair_text": "6\u2206", "created_utc": 1448977262.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3uxy9e", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 2, "name": "t1_cxjdn8l", "id": "cxjdn8l", "parent_id": "t1_cxjbmtq", "depth": 1, "children": ["cxjdn8l"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cxjbmtq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Cheeseboyardee", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_3uxy9e", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Actually, your asking this question is why there is a point to arguing and explaining whether or not one can be racist towards white people. \n\nAlthough there is no particular order of importance...

Again, white people have many institutional and systemic advantages that boil down to even a personal level (ex: resumes with &amp;quot;black sounding&amp;quot; names getting less interviews) and so, a white person claiming to have experiences racism on an institutional level is a dubious claim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In summary, the argument isn&amp;#39;t pointless; it is a debate about whether power dynamics can ever exist that allow white to be discriminated against.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cxj9nrl", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/3uxy9e/cmv_the_argument_of_whether_or_not_you_can_be/cxj9nrl/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1449018209.0, "author_flair_text": "1\u2206", "created_utc": 1448989409.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3uxy9e", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3uxy9e", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cxjq876", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IAmAN00bie", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cxjfvrm", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Removed, see comment rule 1.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removed, see comment rule 1.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cxjq876", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/3uxy9e/cmv_the_argument_of_whether_or_not_you_can_be/cxjq876/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1449041284.0, "author_flair_text": "19\u2206", "created_utc": 1449012484.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": "moderator"}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cxjfvrm", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_3uxy9e", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "[removed]", "edited": 1448998511.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[removed]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cxjfvrm", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/3uxy9e/cmv_the_argument_of_whether_or_not_you_can_be/cxjfvrm/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1449026946.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1448998146.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3uxy9e", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cxmcpvo", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "PokemonMasterX", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_3uxy9e", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "It is not pointless.
