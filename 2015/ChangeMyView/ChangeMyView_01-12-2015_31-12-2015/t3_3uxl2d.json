What frames the debate in this instance is a Planned Parenthood shooting, on one side you two liberal camps: those who want gun control and those who want to mock republican presidential candidates regarding easily inverted (in this instance) comments about Muslims. The opposition, as I see it, has only one side, claiming either that conservatives and republicans are not to blame for most violent crimes and / or the idea of a radical christian extremist is an anomalous myth lacking data.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the way the debate is framed is rather important, and in the current events context of the Senator&amp;#39;s reply, I felt it didn&amp;#39;t make a fair point. From a liberal standpoint, we should exercise the most radical Republican presidential candidate views ad naseum and register christians and churches (satire, sarcasm, and irony dripping from every one of these viewpoints), or appeal for more gun control (a staple of the Democratic platform for some time).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cruz&amp;#39;s comments don&amp;#39;t seem to address either of these.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;Edit: Upon review, I suppose I&amp;#39;m asking the infinitely unfair question of &amp;quot;so what?&amp;quot;, and in that, I cede.&lt;/del&gt; \u2206&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit2: No; and I&amp;#39;m sorry, but I take this back.
