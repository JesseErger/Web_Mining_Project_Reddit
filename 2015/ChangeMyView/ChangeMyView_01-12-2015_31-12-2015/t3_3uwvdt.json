I have multiple problems with this, but i will address two key ones in this thread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off, who gets to decide what is considered coercive rape? If a wife comes home and and wants to have sex with her husband who is initially dismissive but goes along with it even though he really dosnt want to, has he been raped? According to many people, he has, even though he may see it as simply doing something nice for his wife. If this was made law, it would spawn ridiculous cases such as when two 17 year olds send nude photos to each other, and while neither party nor parents think anything is wrong, the state could prosecute them both for distributing child pornography. Similarly, someone could report that their friend was coerced into sex by someone else and get them in trouble, even if the &amp;quot;violated&amp;quot; party feels nothing is wrong. If it should be law, why would it apply to only sex? What if i didnt want to go to the store, but my partner kept saying &amp;quot;OHH COME ONNNN, LETS GOOOO&amp;quot; and talked me into going to the store, did i just get kidnapped?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly, what makes being up front about sex any less ethical than manipulating people (which is essentially what is publicly accepted). A comment in a current thread has 450 upvotes and says &amp;quot;You cant use regular persuasion. Its unethical. It has to come about naturally. Or at least, make them think it was their idea. Plant a seed that will later bud and bear fruit&amp;quot;. So essentially, its more ethical to trick someone into loving you and thinking they care about you to get sex than to simply be blunt and up-front about it. Think about relationships, if you walked up to a woman on the street and asked for sex, 99.9% chance they will say no. HOWEVER, if you were nice to the same woman, took her out on a few dates, bought her dinner a few times, and THEN slept with her, it is acceptable EVEN THOUGH you may have the same exact motives and the new situation would most likely result in much more heartbreak and emotional damage to the one who has been tricked. Dating in general is basically one big game of trying to convince the other person to mate with you, but trying to convince someone to have sex straight up is apparently RAPE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT #2:&lt;/strong&gt; What i am essentially talking about is sexual PERSUASION, however i decided to use the word &amp;quot;Coercion&amp;quot; because of its rising popularity and that it is the word i see being thrown around the most when it comes to any discussion of trying to get someone to have sex with you after an initial &amp;quot;No&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Let me start out by saying that i am not talking about the technical definition of coercion (to \"persuade (an unwilling person) to do something by using force or threats.\"), but the way it has been being used by feminists to define pretty much any suggestion of sexual acts without an immediate \"YES!\" **EDIT:** Blackmail is obviously rape, i am not talking about situations where someone says something like \"Have sex with me or i will send your nudes to the entire office!!\", i am talking about how people consider sex after pressuring for it after the initial \"No\" to be rape.\n\nRecently the idea has been getting popularized that if you ask someone to have sex and they say no, then proceed to say something such as \"Ohh come on\" and then they agree, its rape.

The same thing could happen where a husband would think &amp;quot;Yea i didnt want to have sex with my wife, but whatever&amp;quot; while a third party could say &amp;quot;NO, YOU HAVE BEEN RAPED&amp;quot; and try to get the wife prosecuted, even while the husband and wife believe nothing is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;HOWEVER, if you were nice to the same woman, took her out on a few dates, bought her dinner a few times, and THEN slept with her, it is acceptable EVEN THOUGH you may have the same exact motives and the new situation would most likely result in much more heartbreak and emotional damage to the one who has been tricked.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assuming you dump them afterwards, that&amp;#39;s called &amp;quot;stringing someone along,&amp;quot; and it&amp;#39;s not socially acceptable. It&amp;#39;s not a crime, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s acceptable. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although people generally agree that &amp;quot;stringing someone along&amp;quot; is socially unacceptable, everyone sees it happen to people they know or themselves and there is no real consequence for the one stringing along besides being labeled an &amp;quot;Asshole&amp;quot; by the person who got stringed along and their friends. Obviously society does not have much of a problem with it if it persists without any real opposition. Back to the point i was making earlier, if its illegal to pressure someone to have sex with you and they give in due to their weak fortitude, how come its not illegal to manipulate someone to have sex with you? The only real differences are that one requires a greater degree of intelligence, is sneakier, and is more devoid of empathy, yet is still legal. I would argue that manipulation is much more morally wrong that simply asking &amp;quot;Pleaseee have sex with me, come on, it will be fun, dont be like this ect
