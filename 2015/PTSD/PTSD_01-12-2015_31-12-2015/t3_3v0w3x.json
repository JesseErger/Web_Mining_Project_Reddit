I felt like I was wasting my time, I was ready to give up and didn&amp;#39;t see a point in carrying on. I didn&amp;#39;t see a point in living anymore.

But here&amp;#39;s the thing. I went through my trauma at a young age. I&amp;#39;ve had it for as long as I can remember. It has become part of me and I don&amp;#39;t know what it&amp;#39;s like to live without PTSD. I am certain in the fact that it can be managed and that I can live a happy life, goddamnit. Yes I&amp;#39;ll have nightmares and fear for the rest of my life. It sucks. But I&amp;#39;ll manage. Managing is all I can do.

She has even gone as far as saying that I &lt;strong&gt;deserved it&lt;/strong&gt; (that was another time and she was angry, I&amp;#39;m over it) Now, these don&amp;#39;t sound like words of encouragement, especially coming from your own mother. I&amp;#39;m just stronger than this. I&amp;#39;ve been through a lot. Her words don&amp;#39;t even hurt anymore and It makes me feel strong.
