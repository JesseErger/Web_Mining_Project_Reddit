Anger is not a key component of PTSD although it can be present at times. I am typically emotionally detached and numb. Sometimes I do get angry but it is more like a rage. This happens only when I feel threatened. The flight or flight response is common in those with PTSD and anger can be like an emotional weapon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "ptsd", "name": "t1_cungeda", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ptsd/comments/3j8gsv/a_question_about_ptsd_cptsd_and_anger/cungeda/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1441171061.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1441142261.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ptsd", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm0x", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3j8gsv", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cunb73w", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bodhibell02", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_3j8gsv", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "CPTSD/PTSD Here.
