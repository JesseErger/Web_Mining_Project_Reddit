I don&amp;#39;t use those terms myself, but i didn&amp;#39;t know another way to describe it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it started with a lot of the tumblr culture. People would start to put trigger warnings on everything, and people who even admittedly were not diagnosed with PTSD, who did not know what it is like to have PTSD would use the word for things they did not like. This still happens in the media everywhere. To be honest, i think it really trivialises PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now there are people on the other hand who make fun of those who use the word &amp;#39;triggered&amp;#39; for everything.

Because there are some people out there who actually suffer from PTSD that get caught in the crossfire because of this.

This word seems like it has been hijacked and turned into something else by those two groups of people. The way i see it, people don&amp;#39;t take the word seriously anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, i have never liked trigger warnings. I feel as though it does more harm than good. It feels embarrassing to me, it makes me feel as though others think I am fragile and weak to need such a warning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know about others, but i also feel that it really doesn&amp;#39;t help. Avoidance is a big symptom in PTSD. I now understand that the nightmares i have every single night that i manage to get some sleep are due to me subconsciously pushing away all of those memories and thoughts that bother me during the day to the back of my head, trying to never think about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realize i have these nightmares because the brain needs me to deal with it, to process it. The part of the brain that determines fight or flight is more active when we are asleep. I think the nightmares are actually healthy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Avoidance does not solve the problem, it merely shoves it under the rug. Dealing with these thoughts and feelings head on is the only thing that can eventually give me relief. Admittedly, I&amp;#39;m not at that stage where i feel i can talk about these events with others and deal with them. However, i feel as though I am getting close.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I often times feel that when something is out there or around that could make me have flashbacks or panic attacks. I don&amp;#39;t want to be trigger warned about these things anymore. I avoid too much, I&amp;#39;m starting to think the exposure to some of these things is good for me. Maybe not in the short term, but in the long term i think it definitely is, it forces me to deal with the thoughts and process them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve become sick of trigger warnings.

It's a video poking fun at trigger warnings. I found it a little funny admittedly, but at the same time it shows how the word has been turned into a joke in the media and online. The fact that stuff similar to this happens, on a (much, smaller scale) but still happens nonetheless, in schools, colleges, the media and online.

I completely understand you wouldn't want to read or watch something like that, i  wouldn't, and i would imagine the vast majority of people wouldn't want to. I don't think that would mean you are avoiding processing your trauma.

It just means that, generally, I prefer to spend my free time not getting upset. Trigger/content warnings help me achieve that goal. \n\nAgain, I'm not talking about forcing anyone to read or watch stuff like that. There are the really petty things i was talking about, then there is the stuff on the smaller or middle scale, maybe a teacher saying trigger warning before talking about some things. For example, mentioning a war that is happening, or just saying the name of a historical figure who was a rapist. When people use trigger warnings with stuff like that, on that scale, i feel as though for myself, it adds to avoidance. I have a huge problem with avoidance in general, so i guess that's why i feel as if they do more harm than good for me. \n\nNow when things are becoming extremely graphic, I'm fine with those types of warnings. I think people should be warned before witnessing such things. Like you said, just like 'R' ratings, i think they are useful, in that sense.\n\nEveryone has different experiences though. Like i said in the OP,something someone one may find to be a small deal could be a huge deal to someone else and vice versa. Who am i to judge what should and shouldn't be warned.
