Not to mock her and her behaviour, nor my past behaviour, but just giggling for no apparent reason at all; I found the situation entertaining to a degree but I felt no happiness or joy from it. That alone is an improvement; at one point in time I would have felt rage and hate toward the woman and probably would have intervened on dude&amp;#39;s behalf by being an asshole driver myself.
