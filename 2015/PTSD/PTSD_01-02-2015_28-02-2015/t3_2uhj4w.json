I stopped because mom didn&amp;#39;t have time to take me anymore. I have a car now but I was always too scared to call up and go by myself. Last night my boyfriend said he&amp;#39;d call for me. I feel weird that my boyfriend is calling, but I can&amp;#39;t be the only one who freaks out on the phone, right? I tried ordering Chinese food once and the lady asked if I wanted pork fried rice and I started crying. -___-; It was actually in the way beginning of our relationship and he didn&amp;#39;t know about my PTSD. I blamed it on my period. We can laugh about it now, which I guess is good. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend says all those things too. And I know how hard it is to believe him when he says it. Not because I don&amp;#39;t trust him, it&amp;#39;s just because I have a list of a million reasons why he should leave me and run. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think this is the first time I ever realized how angry I am. I knew I was, I mentioned it once or twice before. But I had a full on breakdown sobbing hysterically in the car last night.
