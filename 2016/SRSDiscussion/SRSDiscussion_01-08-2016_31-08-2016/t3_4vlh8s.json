You definitely run the risk of exoticizing East Asia when you view it through the eyes of a westerner, but the reality of the situation is that eastern culture IS alien, IS complicated to the uneducated western mind (and, quite obviously, vice versa). Christianity can easily apprehend Islam; Taoism requires more work. There's nothing wrong with displaying this difficulty in comprehension--and the struggles that accompany it--in film.  \n\nNow, back to generalities. I think whitewashing is a horrific problem in the film industry. It rears its head most indefensibly, in my mind, in depictions of fictional worlds (see the avatar movie, or the Earthsea show, or the reaction to a black Hermione). Equally indefensible are depictions like you describe on Bringing Down the House, where race is (apparently? Haven't read or watched it) irrelevant to the narrative. There's no excuse for that beyond making whites comfortable. \n\nIn short, the existence of white strangers in a strange land doesn't bother me per se (though it has to be done very well to avoid orientalism, and I would like to see some reversals of the trope).

Also, Cruise&amp;#39;s character isn&amp;#39;t really any sort of hero. He doesn&amp;#39;t save the day; all he manages to do is survive. Is there a problem with SHOGUN because the protagonist is English?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think there is. You definitely run the risk of exoticizing East Asia when you view it through the eyes of a westerner, but the reality of the situation is that eastern culture IS alien, IS complicated to the uneducated western mind (and, quite obviously, vice versa). Christianity can easily apprehend Islam; Taoism requires more work. There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with displaying this difficulty in comprehension--and the struggles that accompany it--in film.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, back to generalities. I think whitewashing is a horrific problem in the film industry. It rears its head most indefensibly, in my mind, in depictions of fictional worlds (see the avatar movie, or the Earthsea show, or the reaction to a black Hermione). Equally indefensible are depictions like you describe on Bringing Down the House, where race is (apparently? Haven&amp;#39;t read or watched it) irrelevant to the narrative. There&amp;#39;s no excuse for that beyond making whites comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, the existence of white strangers in a strange land doesn&amp;#39;t bother me per se (though it has to be done very well to avoid orientalism, and I would like to see some reversals of the trope). But that&amp;#39;s hardly the only instance of whitewashing, and it&amp;#39;s a real problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "SRSDiscussion", "name": "t1_d5ze2a1", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/4vlh8s/what_do_you_all_think_about_constance_wus_remarks/d5ze2a1/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1470071773.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1470042973.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SRSDiscussion", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t5sa", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 8, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4vlh8s", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": null, "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t5sa", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 7, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4vlh8s", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d646ewb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "scifigeek83", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d624ykh", "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "You have been downvoted by people who have never been to East Asia/China, and I think it kind of shows.
