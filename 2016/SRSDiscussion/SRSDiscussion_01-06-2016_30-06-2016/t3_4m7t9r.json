Its also possible to roll this out partially, on a state by state basis, with state governments administering it differently. I even think that some firms in the states have internal policies that offer something similar, e.g. Rolls Royce, which is UK-based but with factories in the US, and has a policy of consistent employee rights including maternity leave. So it is possible to place the burden on the private sector if necessary, but this is obviously less desirable than a public program.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "SRSDiscussion", "name": "t1_d3ugf2h", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/4m7t9r/maternity_leave_national_bank/d3ugf2h/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1464991398.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1464962598.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SRSDiscussion", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}]
