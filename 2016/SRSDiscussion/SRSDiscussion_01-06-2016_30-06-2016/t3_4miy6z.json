This isn't to say those historical events don't continue to affect the US, but I'm basically trying to figure out the differences between the way ethnicity and nationalism intersect in the US and European nation-states in political discourse today. I think the type of racial politics you see in the US with people like Trump is also present in European countries, but the idea of European countries forming on national lines (as per the opinions of my friend in the first post) with most citizens identifying as a nationality corresponding with their state adds an extra dimension to exclusionary and/or anti-internationalism rhetoric. Trump doesn't say Mexicans shouldn't be in the US simply because they're from another country; he has to paint them as criminals or people who are against American values. In contrast, it seems like simply having too many people who aren't of the majority ethnicity in a country like the UK or Germany is portrayed (at least by the right wing) as threatening to the fabric of the country. It's not uncommon for Americans to be against something like outsourcing on the basis that American companies should look to help American citizens first; this kind of \"my country should look out for its own interests first and prioritize its own citizens\" isn't unusual at all. However, when I look at something like Brexit and the EU, I think there's an added element of \"my country should look out for *my people* and keep *other people* out, because this is our nation-state and we need to look out for our own interests first.\" In other words, it's appealing to self-determination for an ethnic nation in a way modern American politics don't outside of white power groups - while American politicians do target whites and try to appeal to them, the idea of the US as a country for people of a particular ethnicity is a fringe view.\n\n&gt;It is worth noting that Britain is itself an immigrant nation, simply over a much longer timescale which stretches into pre-history. \n\nBut would most British people identify with the idea of being an immigrant nation? Most Americans are connected in some way to the ethnicity of the country they/their ancestors immigrated from, be it actively carrying on cultural traditions or just thinking of themselves as \"Irish-American\" every now and then. [As this link shows, only a small percentage of Americans identify their ethnicity as \"American.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_ethnicity) \n\nThere are definitely parallels in how Trump and groups like PEGIDA attempt to paint their opposition to immigration as a clash of values rather than racism and/or xenophobia. It's also true that my knowledge of this subject is disproportionately informed by reading about the rise of nationalistic far-right groups in Europe. However, I still think my friend's original point has some merit: that there are differences in how Americans and Europeans view their ethnicity with relation to the state they live in and that state's interests, and those differences make it hard for Americans to understand the nuances of anti-EU sentiment.", "edited": 1465101885.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s certainly true historically, given things like the Chinese Exclusion Act and the links you posted, but I&amp;#39;m referring more to the current political climate. This isn&amp;#39;t to say those historical events don&amp;#39;t continue to affect the US, but I&amp;#39;m basically trying to figure out the differences between the way ethnicity and nationalism intersect in the US and European nation-states in political discourse today. I think the type of racial politics you see in the US with people like Trump is also present in European countries, but the idea of European countries forming on national lines (as per the opinions of my friend in the first post) with most citizens identifying as a nationality corresponding with their state adds an extra dimension to exclusionary and/or anti-internationalism rhetoric. Trump doesn&amp;#39;t say Mexicans shouldn&amp;#39;t be in the US simply because they&amp;#39;re from another country; he has to paint them as criminals or people who are against American values. In contrast, it seems like simply having too many people who aren&amp;#39;t of the majority ethnicity in a country like the UK or Germany is portrayed (at least by the right wing) as threatening to the fabric of the country. It&amp;#39;s not uncommon for Americans to be against something like outsourcing on the basis that American companies should look to help American citizens first; this kind of &amp;quot;my country should look out for its own interests first and prioritize its own citizens&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t unusual at all. However, when I look at something like Brexit and the EU, I think there&amp;#39;s an added element of &amp;quot;my country should look out for &lt;em&gt;my people&lt;/em&gt; and keep &lt;em&gt;other people&lt;/em&gt; out, because this is our nation-state and we need to look out for our own interests first.&amp;quot; In other words, it&amp;#39;s appealing to self-determination for an ethnic nation in a way modern American politics don&amp;#39;t outside of white power groups - while American politicians do target whites and try to appeal to them, the idea of the US as a country for people of a particular ethnicity is a fringe view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that Britain is itself an immigrant nation, simply over a much longer timescale which stretches into pre-history. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But would most British people identify with the idea of being an immigrant nation? Most Americans are connected in some way to the ethnicity of the country they/their ancestors immigrated from, be it actively carrying on cultural traditions or just thinking of themselves as &amp;quot;Irish-American&amp;quot; every now and then. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_ethnicity\"&gt;As this link shows, only a small percentage of Americans identify their ethnicity as &amp;quot;American.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are definitely parallels in how Trump and groups like PEGIDA attempt to paint their opposition to immigration as a clash of values rather than racism and/or xenophobia.

It is argued that the EU imposes heavy and unhelpful regulation. OECD studies show that the UK has the second least-regulated product markets among industrial countries and the least-regulated labour markets in the EU. Regulation has benefits. Co-ordination (for example, common safety standards for electrical products) is a necessary part of a single market, making it easier to trade.
