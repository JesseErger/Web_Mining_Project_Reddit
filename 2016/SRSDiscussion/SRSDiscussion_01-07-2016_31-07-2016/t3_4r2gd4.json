I think if reddit was a website for the super wealthy there would be much more content that could be featured in prime (eg. stuff like trumps small loan of 1 million dollars).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A decent chunk of it is that SRS users are more familiar with sexism, racism, homophobia and transphobia than they are with class, so are more able to see dog whistles or other indicators for these topics.  (e.g. using females instead of women).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also there are some quite big anarchist, socialist and communist communities on reddit where people that focus on class tend to congregate, and targeted subs like &lt;a href=\"/r/ShitLiberalsSay\"&gt;/r/ShitLiberalsSay&lt;/a&gt; that could be attracting the people that may have otherwise ended up participating more in SRS.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "SRSDiscussion", "name": "t1_d4ya44c", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/4r2gd4/are_we_as_openminded_as_we_think_we_are/d4ya44c/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1467622823.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1467594023.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SRSDiscussion", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d4y9qsh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Suddenly_Elmo", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d4y8s40", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Yeah, you're right that it's not really what he's talking about, although I think the criticism is pointing at a similar thing - worrying about saying the right things and having the right attitudes towards people of a certain identity, without thinking about the structural issues which underpin oppression.\n\nAnd yeah, it is class related, but only in that the person being called out for fatphobia is a leftie.
