I think, at the very least, if something reinforces, reinscribes, etc. harmful social norms, it is wrong to do it. This is the sort of investigation that would be most pertinent to an idea of social justice concerned with the activity of &lt;em&gt;systems&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;structures&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To figure out whether saying a word does this, you might ask, what &amp;#39;calls for it&amp;#39;; in other words, when is it said? What sorts of behaviors or qualities warrant this particular insult? Are these behaviors and qualities distinctly gendered in our society? What kinds of people usually get called this insult? The answers to these questions (and others) can reveal a lot about the social norms that any particular insult is meant to reinforce; I think it&amp;#39;s obvious what &amp;#39;the c word&amp;#39; is meant to reinforce in US parlance, but it&amp;#39;s less obvious &lt;em&gt;to me&lt;/em&gt; what it&amp;#39;s meant to reinforce in the UK since I don&amp;#39;t live there and so I can&amp;#39;t reasonably answer any of the previous questions.
