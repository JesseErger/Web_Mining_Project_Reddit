A lot of people are saying that it is democratic, and it is to an extent, but there are still some serious issues with it.\n\n\n1) **Turnout.**  EU elections have low turnout when compared to general elections. In the UK the last EU election had a turnout of 35%, and the EU average was 42%. The EU average turnout is in a trend of dropping. See the turnout rates here: http://www.ukpolitical.info/european-parliament-election-turnout.htm\n\nIMO ~ 40% turnout is not a healthy level. Voter fatigue becomes an issue, when you pile up the number of things they can vote for, people vote less.\n\n2)**Voter Information**\nThe EU, and come to think of it the UN, is quite a complex organisation, probably more complex than just a national government due to all the moving parts required to pass laws across various nations. I would venture that even people who are very well educated or keep up with current affairs may have little idea of the structure/ what actually goes on at the EU, considering the complex relationship of the European Central Bank, the European Council, Parliament and Commission.\n\nIt makes me question whether the majority of voters in EU elections are informed on what their candidate/party will do to a good extent. Also most voters will take less time to inform themselves of this, as the EU election is seen as less significant. \n\n3)**Undemocratic Elements** In the EU European Council makes a lot of important decisions on defence, immigration policy and the essential nature of the EU itself. It is composed of the elected leaders of the member states, however its decisions are not scrutinised by the parliament. \n\nSimilarly the European Commission is a civil service which is not elected which makes many vital decisions on exactly how laws are implemented, and is not really held accountable democratically.\n\n\n\nUltimately the combination of all these factors means that the EU is nowhere near as democratic as the governments of its member states.\n\nSome of these issues may be fixable, but not easily at all. Right now I think the key issue is a lack of engagement with voters for the EU - there is low turnout, and many people elect anti EU candidates for the parliament just as an FU to the whole thing. \n\n\nOverall I think the issue with large, international organisations is that as the electorate of a democracy grows, the individual voices within it grow quieter and quieter. International organisations can only please a large number of people when the aims of the individuals within their member states are aligned. In the case of the EU, a lot of EU countries have broadly similar political positions, so it works to an extent. Some sort of completely international EU to pass laws would probably be a good thing if possible, however I do wonder whether you would have sufficiently similar aims and outlooks from the countries within it to get anything done. \n\nHence for now I think that the UN works OK - countries can cooperate on certain issues like climate change, nuclear disarmament etc where they share broadly similar aims and continue to pursue their own policy elsewhere.\n\n**TL;DR : The EU is not perfectly democratic and has some serious issues.

If states don&amp;#39;t wish to partake in democratic discourse then any democratic institution won&amp;#39;t help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: My point of view is solely from a state&amp;#39;s perspective, there have historically been very successful non-state international institutions which are democratic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "SRSDiscussion", "name": "t1_d1o06bc", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/4d53i5/can_democracy_be_reconciled_with_international/d1o06bc/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1459715695.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1459686895.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SRSDiscussion", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t5sa", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4d53i5", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d1o26gg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_4d53i5", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "What do you mean by \"internationalism\"?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you mean by &amp;quot;internationalism&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "SRSDiscussion", "name": "t1_d1o26gg", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/4d53i5/can_democracy_be_reconciled_with_international/d1o26gg/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1459720948.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1459692148.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SRSDiscussion", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}]
