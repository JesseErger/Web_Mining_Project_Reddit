Although there is a good amount of indirect research that would at least make the hypotheses I put forward worth testing.  But yeah - they are hypotheses only and I should flag that more clearly when talking about them.  If you're interested in the theoretical framework that's informing my analysis then check out:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_theory\n\nThe original concept comes from evolutionary biology - but don't let that deter you - it's entirely possible to use the idea as a model for various behavious without assuming that those behaviours are necessarily determined biologically.\n\n&gt; Rather, it's more of a capital-specific problem, rooted in the capitalist base insofar as capital seeks to make a profit off of anything it possibly can...\n\nYeah we're definitely working to different models and hence the difference in perspective.  But I don't want to reject any of the specifics you said here really.  I suspect that we'd find the two perspectives probably cohere quite a bit if we had the time to work through the details.\n\n&gt;But the signaling, if it occurs, is not white people trying to fit in with black people (which, if anything, that is a side phenomenon that only occurs after one ends up believing the myths propagated by the essentialized, otherized, and commodified blackness sometimes made by and usually sold to white people), but white people trying to entertain and fit in with other white people.\n\nYep - I agree that in the case of white and black culture it's probably more accurate to say it's more about impressing other white people and should have put more emphasis on this in my original post - although I'd contend this varies depending on the domain of marginalisation you're looking at.  I'd also suggest it depends on a lot on what stage the process of cultural appropriation is at.  The very earliest appropriators are risking the highest signalling costs for adopting foreign signalling behaviours... as such they are much more likely to be seeking approval from the marginalised.  But the safer the trailblazers (using that word somewhat ironically) make it for other white folk, signalling costs drop, and the more it becomes about white folks looking for an edge in the signalling games taking place within their own peer groups.  \n\nCertainly, the great bulk of visible appropriation of black culture happens in this later phase.  But at the same time - the latter phase can't occur without the earlier.  It's for this reason that makes me wonder whether the marxist story gets the etiology right.  It's possible those white folk seeking acceptance in cultures foreign to their own are just driven by the same systemic features of capitalism that are observable at the macro level.  But the difficulty with this supposition is that they are engaging with those foreign cultures BEFORE those broader, cultural processes of fetishisation could occur.  Those white folk are the ones least constrained by the signalling constraints imposed by their native culture.  I think systemic explanations have to do a bit of fancy footwork to fit this behaviour into their models.  imo - the signalling approach which models individuals as they compete and co-operate within local groups has an advantage in this respect. \n\nBut ultimately - it's always going to be extremely difficult to determine which account is correct.  There is certainly no smoking gun that shows your marxist explanation can't be right.\n\nAnyway - I've written a lot already and so will have to leave off commenting about your response to that trade analogy.

I suspect that we&amp;#39;d find the two perspectives probably cohere quite a bit if we had the time to work through the details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But the signaling, if it occurs, is not white people trying to fit in with black people (which, if anything, that is a side phenomenon that only occurs after one ends up believing the myths propagated by the essentialized, otherized, and commodified blackness sometimes made by and usually sold to white people), but white people trying to entertain and fit in with other white people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yep - I agree that in the case of white and black culture it&amp;#39;s probably more accurate to say it&amp;#39;s more about impressing other white people and should have put more emphasis on this in my original post - although I&amp;#39;d contend this varies depending on the domain of marginalisation you&amp;#39;re looking at.  I&amp;#39;d also suggest it depends on a lot on what stage the process of cultural appropriation is at.  The very earliest appropriators are risking the highest signalling costs for adopting foreign signalling behaviours... as such they are much more likely to be seeking approval from the marginalised.  But the safer the trailblazers (using that word somewhat ironically) make it for other white folk, signalling costs drop, and the more it becomes about white folks looking for an edge in the signalling games taking place within their own peer groups.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Certainly, the great bulk of visible appropriation of black culture happens in this later phase.  But at the same time - the latter phase can&amp;#39;t occur without the earlier.  It&amp;#39;s for this reason that makes me wonder whether the marxist story gets the etiology right.  It&amp;#39;s possible those white folk seeking acceptance in cultures foreign to their own are just driven by the same systemic features of capitalism that are observable at the macro level.  But the difficulty with this supposition is that they are engaging with those foreign cultures BEFORE those broader, cultural processes of fetishisation could occur.  Those white folk are the ones least constrained by the signalling constraints imposed by their native culture.  I think systemic explanations have to do a bit of fancy footwork to fit this behaviour into their models.  imo - the signalling approach which models individuals as they compete and co-operate within local groups has an advantage in this respect. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But ultimately - it&amp;#39;s always going to be extremely difficult to determine which account is correct.  There is certainly no smoking gun that shows your marxist explanation can&amp;#39;t be right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway - I&amp;#39;ve written a lot already and so will have to leave off commenting about your response to that trade analogy.  But your point there was very interesting too.  Are we talking too much?

But expecting black people to drop their barriers to entry when white people still enforce so many of their own - is like asking the poor country to drop their tariffs for the rich.\n\nI'm going to work with the free trade analogy, because in developing it, I hope to show you my issue with your account.\n\nThe level of your analysis of the free trade situation is the level of the nation state - poor and rich nation states.  It's understandable that a poor nation state would enact tariffs and other protectionist policy to avoid being overwhelmed by the massive and developed multinationals, financial institutions, and so on of the rich countries (especially given that those rich countries might enact their own protectionist legislation to avoid their own markets being flooded by cheap imported products from countries with lower wages).

While the expression of their anger is completely understandable... it remains, paradoxically, a bad move strategically. The reason for this is the fact that by increasing the signalling costs - they make those signals even more valuable. It would take too long to explain why here... but the upshot is that a better approach would be to seek to decrease the value of those signalling patterns to outsiders. Rather than expressing an anger that seeks to block the behaviour, one should use a \"bemused dismissal\" of their signalling attempts. \"Sure - you can wear whatever hairstyle you like... go for it... I hope it plugs the hole in your life that you are obviously trying to fill.\" This sentiment doesn't even have to be insincere - and I would hope that it wouldn't be. It's just a recognition of the fact that a signal cannot exist without the context in which it is offered... and that they - as outsiders - only succeed in transmitting the fact that they are possessed of a kind of inauthentic lameness... They are signalling - ultimately - that they are running away from a failure to compete and signal successfully in their own peer groups. They signal nothing more than their failure and alienation.\n\nAnd because, by trying to gain acceptance in a group other than their own, they signal their failure and alienation, they should be mocked for daring to signal aspects of a socially constructed identity other than their own.\n\nIt's bizarre, because I suspect most people here are well aware that identity (including gender) is socially constructed.

The value - therefore - is that they get further social mobility when they already had far more than the bona-fide members.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This strikes me as theoretically questionable.  For instance, when Elvis appropriated rock music, he didn&amp;#39;t do it to gain entry into black spaces - he did it to make money, and made a lot more money than black rock artists because he was white.  His white skin was a signaling mechanism to white people that the music was now &amp;quot;safe,&amp;quot; and that&amp;#39;s why he made money.  It was precisely because he was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an outsider in the way marginalized black people were that this appropriation happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But note also - the cost to the minority group is that not only do they face greater probability of having to interact with people they (when seeking like company) would like to avoid - the existence of these appropriators makes it harder for them to recognise each other as bona-fide members.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider the other side of this story though - privileged groups also police their boundaries.  In fact, I&amp;#39;d go further and apply everything you wrote to people who have privilege.  Part of the entire problem of white supremacy (or patriarchy, or homophobia, so on) is that marginalized people who, because the signaling aspect is in this case literally one&amp;#39;s race, gender, and so on, are denied access to those privileges given to the people who do have the correct identity-signals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Having said all that - I agree with you that the approach of increasing signalling costs on those who engage in cultural appreciation - is probably a flawed approach. While the expression of their anger is completely understandable... it remains, paradoxically, a bad move strategically. The reason for this is the fact that by increasing the signalling costs - they make those signals even more valuable. It would take too long to explain why here... but the upshot is that a better approach would be to seek to decrease the value of those signalling patterns to outsiders. Rather than expressing an anger that seeks to block the behaviour, one should use a &amp;quot;bemused dismissal&amp;quot; of their signalling attempts. &amp;quot;Sure - you can wear whatever hairstyle you like... go for it... I hope it plugs the hole in your life that you are obviously trying to fill.&amp;quot; This sentiment doesn&amp;#39;t even have to be insincere - and I would hope that it wouldn&amp;#39;t be. It&amp;#39;s just a recognition of the fact that a signal cannot exist without the context in which it is offered... and that they - as outsiders - only succeed in transmitting the fact that they are possessed of a kind of inauthentic lameness... They are signalling - ultimately - that they are running away from a failure to compete and signal successfully in their own peer groups. They signal nothing more than their failure and alienation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And because, by trying to gain acceptance in a group other than their own, they signal their failure and alienation, they should be mocked for daring to signal aspects of a socially constructed identity other than their own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s bizarre, because I suspect most people here are well aware that identity (including gender) is socially constructed.  Yet the answer to that is... to essentialize these constructed identities into groups whose boundaries are not to be violated.

In other words, its value is not intrinsic but contingent.\n\nAgain, this strikes me as a majority-biased POV. First of all, I don't think \"harm\" is the right word here. A white American rockabilly is not \"harmed\" by the idea or statement that they should not be using/misrepresenting say, Mexican D\u00eda de los Muertos imagery. They just aren't. One can appreciate a culture without misrepresenting it; the idea of cultural appropriation absolutely does not preclude that.\n\nSecond, marginalized cultures are *already* marginalized; that's what makes them appropriable (ie: it\u2019s what allows them to be appropriated, and it\u2019s what makes non-members *want* to appropriate them). And it's cultural appropriation that (further) minimizes source cultures, in that it reduces them to one or a few decontextualized features, as when someone like Miley Cyrus reduces hip hop to just a few not-exactly-random features that appeal to the majority for entirely non-originator reasons, while discarding most of its originator-meaningful underpinnings/context. The origin culture is treated like a buffet, and only the parts attractive to the majority (for whatever reasons) are adopted and rebroadcasted.\n\nAnd since cultural appropriation\u2014 at least as I know it in the white English-speaking West\u2014 is typically a way for majority members to differentiate themselves from the majority (or even antagonize it), the value of the origin culture is mostly in its strangeness to the majority. That's what's played up. IOW, its value (to the appropriators) is entirely unrelated to, and sometimes directly *contrary* to, its value to the cultural owners. And this can and does harm them, in that often, they're so marginalized as to be invisible\u2026 until a distored-by-the-majority-lens version suddenly floods the majority consciousness. And they can't compete with that version, because the majority voice drowns theirs out (at that point the majority are talking to *each other;* the minority group is not part of the conversation). So they go straight from unknown to *incorrectly*-known (not an improvement), and often there's no space left for them to correct the distored representation. *Just like before.* Frex, more people are being exposed to Native American war bonnets as quirky white hipster fashion accessories than as the sacred artifacts they are\u2014 there are way more Instagram hipsters, with a way louder collective voice on the subject of war bonnets, than there are Native Americans, total.\n\nAgain, to be clear, I'm not at all against cultural diffusion and cultural mixing.

Theoretically, with a feminist or gay rights group which focused exclusively on their own specific oppression and no other, this might not have been such a problem. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "subreddit": "SRSDiscussion", "name": "t1_d1nxupp", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/4d3kib/what_are_some_legitimate_leftist_criticisms_of/d1nxupp/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1459706688.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1459677888.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SRSDiscussion", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t5sa", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 34, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4d3kib", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": null, "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t5sa", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 7, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4d3kib", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": null, "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t5sa", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 20, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4d3kib", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": null, "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t5sa", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4d3kib", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": null, "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t5sa", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 20, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4d3kib", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": null, "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t5sa", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4d3kib", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": null, "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t5sa", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 17, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4d3kib", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d1ochm7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RobertoBolano", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d1o48d7", "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "But you are clearly misunderstanding me.

To name a couple: \n\n1.) 'sexuality' as it's defined by the movements from the 60's to the 90's isn't just about identity or rights, it's about different ways of imagining social relationships _in general_.  One of the famous quotes that's often used on this point is Michel Foucault's statement that what probably motivated homophobia around specific practices like sex in bath houses was not simply revulsion around anal sex or male effeminacy but the notion that the people who were having sex in bath houses _genuinely loved each other._ That's not supposed to be what love is: for one thing, if people can love each anonymously but through specific practices 'we' lose social control over it and other social institutions (e.g. marriage) that are regulated through love. That might not be so bad.    \n\n2.) There are forms of racism that may not require bigoted dispositions towards particular individuals or even treat racialized individuals as strictly rational actors. The example that always comes to mind for me is the _Freakonomics_ argument that the major reason for the decline of crime after the late 1970's was the legalization of abortion. Note that there is nothing facially racist about this argument _on that definition_: it doesn't even mention race. By most definitions of 'racism' that are current on places like Reddit it _cannot_ be racist _ipso facto_. But it's pretty obvious what it's implying in the context of the larger debate over crime in the United States, and it is also an argument for a certain kind of policy: to effectively control the population of undesirables, now we shall recede from state engagement with the black family. The thing is that race in the United States has long been functional to a desire to confine, nourish and control an oppressed subject population in the first place. That's _why_ we have these cultural obsessions about skin tone, IQ scores, and blood quantum in the first place.    \n\n3.) Virtually any 'choice' or 'preferences' based argument structured around the wage gap. It's basically true that career choice accounts for the majority of the wage gap as a statistical phenomenon. The question is what this means. In contrast to the other two examples above, the jiggery-pokey here is a little more obvious insofar as any generic set of preferences can be defined around any hypothetical individual. Part of the issue, obviously,  is that career choice is often structured around gender socialization. But there's also the question of why the wage gap based on plain old wage discrimination closed. A lot of this is because women were forced into the job market by declining median wages, shifts in the labor market (which is favoring to some extent traditionally feminine service jobs) and also the non-compensation of housework. This is sometimes called 'the feminization of work.' Exclusive focus on individual actors and the definition of market forces as top-down, restrictive oppression rather than on what is 'productive' about power makes this hard to see. And in a lot of ways, femininity isn't just defined by gesture and interaction or whatever, it's defined by the kind of labor you do. That's like the whole etymology of the word 'labor.' \n\nYou'll notice that all three of these examples have to do with the social institution of the family. There is a reason for this. Traditional marxist arguments _contra_ the concept of intersectionality are pretty simple, and not entirely wrong: they say that it's a liberal concept that analytically privileges the individual over the interests of the working class. This argument never goes anywhere because it's tossing in class as a _deus ex machina._ What I've tried to argue for here is a more nuanced version of that criticism: this particular _kind_ of liberal individualism can't be established without some kind of implied argument about the desirability of the family as a privatized space and that this is an argument that is functional to power. Seeing this requires more nuanced considerations of particular problems than anti-oppression analysis--which is most typically popular with college students who are newly physically separated from their families for the first time--generally provides.

That&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we have these cultural obsessions about skin tone, IQ scores, and blood quantum in the first place.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3.) Virtually any &amp;#39;choice&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;preferences&amp;#39; based argument structured around the wage gap. It&amp;#39;s basically true that career choice accounts for the majority of the wage gap as a statistical phenomenon. The question is what this means. In contrast to the other two examples above, the jiggery-pokey here is a little more obvious insofar as any generic set of preferences can be defined around any hypothetical individual. Part of the issue, obviously,  is that career choice is often structured around gender socialization. But there&amp;#39;s also the question of why the wage gap based on plain old wage discrimination closed. A lot of this is because women were forced into the job market by declining median wages, shifts in the labor market (which is favoring to some extent traditionally feminine service jobs) and also the non-compensation of housework. This is sometimes called &amp;#39;the feminization of work.&amp;#39; Exclusive focus on individual actors and the definition of market forces as top-down, restrictive oppression rather than on what is &amp;#39;productive&amp;#39; about power makes this hard to see. And in a lot of ways, femininity isn&amp;#39;t just defined by gesture and interaction or whatever, it&amp;#39;s defined by the kind of labor you do. That&amp;#39;s like the whole etymology of the word &amp;#39;labor.&amp;#39; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll notice that all three of these examples have to do with the social institution of the family. There is a reason for this. Traditional marxist arguments &lt;em&gt;contra&lt;/em&gt; the concept of intersectionality are pretty simple, and not entirely wrong: they say that it&amp;#39;s a liberal concept that analytically privileges the individual over the interests of the working class. This argument never goes anywhere because it&amp;#39;s tossing in class as a &lt;em&gt;deus ex machina.&lt;/em&gt; What I&amp;#39;ve tried to argue for here is a more nuanced version of that criticism: this particular &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of liberal individualism can&amp;#39;t be established without some kind of implied argument about the desirability of the family as a privatized space and that this is an argument that is functional to power. Seeing this requires more nuanced considerations of particular problems than anti-oppression analysis--which is most typically popular with college students who are newly physically separated from their families for the first time--generally provides. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "SRSDiscussion", "name": "t1_d1nk4gq", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/4d3kib/what_are_some_legitimate_leftist_criticisms_of/d1nk4gq/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1459672167.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1459643367.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SRSDiscussion", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t5sa", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 13, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4d3kib", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d1nklgh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "nuclearseraph", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_4d3kib", "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "No issues with intersectionality/activism in and of themselves, but I do have two issues with the way that intersectionality/identity politics are sometimes appealed to (mostly by overenthusiastic people who are new to intersectionality and stuff).\n\n\nThe first is the conflation between various beneficiaries of historical or contemporary oppression and people actively working to oppress others.
