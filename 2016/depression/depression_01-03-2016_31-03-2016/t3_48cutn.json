It was amazing. Oh and that other day that we had amazing sex.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her smile, Her face, Her body. Everything was perfect. She was perfect. I can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about her. It hurts thinking about her and the things that will never happen anymore It&amp;#39;s hard when someone who you used to know, no longer gives a shit\n  about you. I need to get her back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That is you talking about your ex.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That was me talking about my ex&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And no, you don&amp;#39;t need to get her back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m gonna tell you something here, that is probably totally new for you.\n I know it might sound crazy, ridiculous at first, but stay with me and be open.\nI don&amp;#39;t want you to believe me, just try it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you have thoughts, memories, stories, about this girl. You assume that you, \nmissing her, or having some feeling, is a direct consequence of her leaving.   You assume that her leaving, or breaking up with you, is making you sad, incomplete,  depressed or any other feeling. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the truth is... it is not like that. Your thoughts are creating your emotions and not the factual situation. Specifically believing those thoughts. When you are in a relationship you believe the thoughts that say im lovable, im likable,\nim good enough, by consequense , when someone breaks up with you, you start believing opposite thoughts and it creates a negative emotion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only time that you feel sad, incomplete, lacking is when you are thinking about the  stories that i mentioned or some other alike.\nWhen you are completely engaged in a physical activity or mentally challenging activity. The thoughts go away, and therefore the emotion is not present.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lets say you are truly immersed in reading a book, completely distracted from your thoughts. \u00bfAre you sad at that moment?\n You are completely engaged in a TV show. \u00bfAre you lacking in that moment ? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, if the emotion is not there, when you are not thinking about it. That means that the  thought is creating the emotion. And not her leaving you or breaking up with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me ask you a question.\n \u00bfCan you control what thoughts pop up into your mind ? \u00bfDo you know what is the next thought you are gonna have ?\n Answer this honestly. Not if you think that you can  control them, in reality and\n  in your own experience, do you control them ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is 2 points about thoughts. \n1.-They are involuntary\n2.-They create emotions when you believe them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do i mean with believing thoughts ?\nGlad you ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Example. You think about your ex, and your thought is something along the lines of i  miss her, i need her back in my life, that moment was amazing, \u00bfWhat i did wrong?\nsomething is bad with me, nobody loves me, what if i had done this thing or that thing different.  Followed by that, you believe that there is something factually wrong with you. You think that you are not gonna be happy without her, you believe that something is&lt;br/&gt;\nwrong with you, you believe that you did something wrong and that you are not lovable.  when you believe any of these things, you feel an emotion (sadness, incompleteness, depression, anxiety)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is most likely physically expressed by tension in your chest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the truth is ...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are being irrational. I was being irrational. You are only looking at one side of the coin Only recalling the good moments, the \u201cperfect\u201d moments.  How absurd its, that you are only recalling the good moments, her virtues and not the arguments that you had, her defects and annoying or bad habits. It wasn&amp;#39;t always perfect as you say, the fights, the times that she made you feel sad, bad, miserable. The times that you desired to be alone. How do you know its gonna be good if you get back together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t know every single outcome that could happen, you don&amp;#39;t know if you are gonna be happier or miserable with her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, YOU DON&amp;#39;T KNOW THE FUTURE and if you do, let me know, that is a  bad ass ability to have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now you can ask these 3 questions and answer honestly, factually, based in reality. not in your ideas or imagination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1- \u00bfAm i 100% sure that if i get back with her, im gonna be happy? 2- \u00bfCan i recall 3 bad moments that we have a bad time as a couple?  If you have bad moments as well that means that the relationship wasn&amp;#39;t always perfect\n3- If she broke up with me \u00bf does that mean that there is something wrong with me ?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look man, everyone in this world have their own expectations, you do as well.  Probably you didn&amp;#39;t fulfill her idea of a \u201cperfect\u201d relationship and nobody ever will, but  somedayshe will understand that, and you have to do as&lt;br/&gt;\nwell. Don&amp;#39;t take anything personal, because in reality it isn&amp;#39;t. Even if she says, i broke up with  him because he is boring. That is HER opinion, and if we ask a 100 people if you are boring or not\n they will say something different. Everything is about perspective.\nSo if you can be boring for some and not boring for others \u00bf Are you boring or not ?  The answer is, you don&amp;#39;t know and you will never\n  know, because is not a factual thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just process that....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was the mental aspect of this. \nNow lets talk about the physical/social aspect of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is what you can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 1.- You need to cut it out completely from your life. And i mean completely. \nErase her phone number, unfriend/block her on Facebook, Whatsapp, Instagram, Snapchat, Myspace, hi5, Metroflog, and whatever other shityou are into and if you still use any of the last three social networks that i mentioned, please die!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 2.- Start meeting new people, talk to girls, go out even if you don&amp;#39;t feel like it, go on a tinder date, practice your hobbies or do something cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 3.- Understand that she is not the only girl in this world, she is not\n  perfect, she is not the one. Move the fuck on !&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 4.- Engage in mind challenging activities, also physical activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you find this helpful.
