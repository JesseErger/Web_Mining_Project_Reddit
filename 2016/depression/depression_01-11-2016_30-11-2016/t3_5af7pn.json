Even to the point where there\u2019s almost impossible to find people who think in another way. It\u2019s the myth of the underlying cause. We tend to see the cause of who we are like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who we are / our situation in life   \u2014\u2014 &amp;gt;  Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  /\\\n  I\n  I\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s the assumption that we are who we are and how we act is because of an underlying factor. This cause is often perceived to be so powerful that there\u2019s nothing to be done. That it will always define us. Or maybe we\u2019re thinking that something could be done but then we have to work with just that underlying cause. We have to work on that level and the cause is so fuzzy and hard to grasp that it is almost impossible to do anything about it anyway. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many seem to react when we hear things about the caste system in India. That people seem to be so convinced about there place during this lifetime to the point that millions of people seem to accept the mistreatment and even support it. Most of them hardly don\u2019t do any resistance and try to change these norms even if they aren\u2019t benefited from it. It\u2019s so deeply in-beaded in the culture that it seem to be hard to change. The caste you were born in is \u201dthe cause\u201d for who they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s the same with the religious fanatic. Having that kind of beliefs seem to lead to that you\u2019re not fully responsible and just a tool in a bigger picture. Your god seem to be the underlying cause and the power behind everything, deciding who you are and what you do. It\u2019s actually kind of a similar thing believing in astrology. That the stars and planets decide who you are and where you are in life. They are the cause and the power behind everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We as rational human beings could see through these kinds of things but the thing is that we aren\u2019t any better. We\u2019re actually not anymore rational than the religious fanatic, the believer of astrology or the accepter of the caste system. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reason is: We just use different words for the same kind of thinking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I myself will certainly slip into similar thinking. I will give you one example. One very common thing is the myth about personality. That you are who you are because of that and you and have a certain set of possibilities and limitations based on your personality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using personality as a foundation for your view of who you are and what you could achieve is arbitrary. What do you base you assumption of you personality on? How you act and feel in the situation you are in now? Opinions of others based on how they\u2019ve interpreted your actions? This could all be preconceived notions. How do you really know what your personality is? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many other modern myths that work the same way. That\u2019s seen as a cause of identity and behavior. Some other self explaining myths are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Self esteem&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Self confidence&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Characteristics&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intelligence&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basing your self image on this is as irrational as anything but we take that for granted. That these things actually are the underlying cause but it might just be a modern kind of self-explaining myth just like the old religious ones or the caste system. To say that someone act in a certain way because of his or her personality is like saying \u201dThe reason why he don\u2019t have a wife is because he\u2019s a bachelor\u201d. It\u2019s the same thing with self esteem, self confidence, characteristics and intelligence. The reason why I act in some way is because of the label I put on myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what does believing in these sort of self explaining myths lead up to? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well\u2026 Actually nothing really\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things remain the same. We already have the answer and that will keep things as they are. This could in worse cases hold us back in relationships that aren\u2019t good for us. In situations that aren\u2019t good for us. And it could certainly hold us back from living the life we want. If you\u2019re not happy with your own self image there\u2019s an alternative way of thinking about this based on proven scientific research:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stimulus + reinforcements \u2014\u2014 &amp;gt; Behavior \u2014\u2014 &amp;gt; Image of your who you are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The stimulus is the thing that\u2019s triggering an effect within yourself, thoughts or emotions, that leads to a certain behavior. This behaviour could then be reinforced by getting something you want or avoiding something you don\u2019t want. The stimulus combined with reinforcements will keep up a behavior and this will in turn lead to affects in your self image. You might in time think that you are intelligent or have the characteristics associated with this behavior. People might also say and think that you seem to have high self esteem or self confidence. You and others will build up the identity of you based on your behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So if you\u2019re not happy with your life in some way. Don\u2019t let self-explaining myths stand in your way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Changing the stimulus or the reinforcement is going to change your behavior and this will in time change your own self image. This has been proven through scientific studies and Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is based on these studies. These studies could actually help us becoming who we want to be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will get to how we could do this in my next post.
