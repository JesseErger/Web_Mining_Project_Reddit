I&amp;#39;m a 20 year old male who has struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts on a daily basis for almost 6 years now, I&amp;#39;ve only told 1 person this, my best friend and when I did it was the biggest relief I&amp;#39;ve ever had because she has been so understanding and listening to me when I&amp;#39;m in need of someone to talk to at 3 at night when the suicidal thoughts reach their peak, I can&amp;#39;t sleep, I don&amp;#39;t trust people I feel like everyone will eventually take advantage of me and leave me because I&amp;#39;m not worth their time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways the reason I&amp;#39;m posting here is because I just need to vent it out and I feel like I&amp;#39;ve been overburdening my best friend lately, my depression has reached an all time low I think of suicide multiple times a day, I&amp;#39;ve watched every video and read every article there is about dealing with depression nothing works, I&amp;#39;ve contacted a doctor so technically 2 people know, but he just sent me to a psychologist who gave me a 4 month wait before our first session so I&amp;#39;m not gonna be able to see him untill 30 august, and I feel like I&amp;#39;m finally done, I bawl my eyes out every night I&amp;#39;m just done the voices in my head are winning the arguement telling me that suicide is the best decision, all the pain and suffering will end, I can&amp;#39;t cope in social situations I feel like I&amp;#39;m just gonna say something stupid or that girls will think I&amp;#39;m a creep and I will fuck it all up like I&amp;#39;ve always done.\nI only have 1 friend, I love being with her because it&amp;#39;s like a time out from the depression, when I&amp;#39;m with her I can just relax and be the person I truly want to be, I can actually experience joy and happiness, but lately she has been kinda pushing me away changing the subject every time I try to ask if she wants to hang out and she works over time every single day and says that in the weekend she just wants to relax, and I respect that I don&amp;#39;t want to be obsessive, it&amp;#39;s just that I have a really hard time making friends and I know it must be a huge burden for her to be my only friend but idk, I don&amp;#39;t see the point in going on it all seems so doomed&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-thanks for reading&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi, I'm a 20 year old male who has struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts on a daily basis for almost 6 years now, I've only
