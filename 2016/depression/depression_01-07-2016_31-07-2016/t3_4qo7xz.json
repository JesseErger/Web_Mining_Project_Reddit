The symptoms you describe are akin to those of adults suffering from ADD.  It&amp;#39;s a stigmatized disease, often attributed to children only, and also often made fun of by the ignorant, and it&amp;#39;s often easy for even those suffering from it to not take it seriously.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my case, I was being suitably treated for depression, but I was continually plagued by lack of motivation and a mounting inability to tackle even the most menial tasks.  I told my doctor about it, and he mentioned ADD to me.  I thought the idea was absurd, by my lack of motivation was becoming such a problem for me that I was willing to try some medication for it.  I ended up trying Vyvanse, and it turned my life around.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have a doctor, I urge you to make an appointment and ask them about it.  If you don&amp;#39;t, find one, even if you can&amp;#39;t afford it (based on my assumption that you can also not afford to continue living your life this way).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "depression", "name": "t1_d4uqgs3", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/4qo7xz/does_anyone_else_feel_like_their_attention_span/d4uqgs3/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1467362117.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1467333317.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 9, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4qo7xz", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d4uxddf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_4qo7xz", "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Thank you for saying it.
