So I&amp;#39;m just going to spill it all out.  This is going to get rather long.  I&amp;#39;ve not put everything down in one place in a long time.  Had a blowup last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to start with some backstory here.  I&amp;#39;m a 26 year old male from Las Vegas.  I don&amp;#39;t know my father and I&amp;#39;ve been raised mostly by a collection of my mother&amp;#39;s ex-girlfriend (they were together when I was born, I was an accident after my mother went out and &amp;quot;revenge fucked&amp;quot; a bunch of guys at a bar after becoming jealous of her girlfriend still sleeping with her husband, who she was still with at the time) and my grandparents.  My mother was bipolar and had a host of addictions including drugs, alcohol and gambling.  She spent time in rehab, mental hospitals, and jail.  Her ex (we&amp;#39;ll call her RT) was a big drinker also, but quit in about ~95 and their relationship didn&amp;#39;t survive it.  RT still made an effort to be around me and treated me as one of her own children.  My grandparents were in their late 70s and raising me for 95% of my childhood.  My grandmother died when I was 10.  My mother died when I was 11.  I was moved away from my grandfather when I was 13, he died later that year. He&amp;#39;s the hardest of the 3 for me. I lived in a group home for near about a year and a half, and then RT adopted me out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was a smart kid.  Smartest in any of my classes growing up.  Typical of my upbringing however, i fucked that off.  I failed nearly every grade after 3rd.  4th and 5th they put me ahead, citing my intelligence and home situation.  6th and 7th were connected in Las Vegas, and I failed those.  I went to the group home that summer and they, again, had me pushed up to 8th based on, again, intelligence and home situation.  I did better in 8th, only needing summer school to pass ahead.  I moved in with RT right ahead of high school, and essentially dropped out.  Showing up every once in a while my first two years and completely not going afterwards.  I picked up a gaming habit.  Played a shit ton of Dota for 4 years, basically.  Oh, and weed.  Was an every day smoker at 12 years old, and picked that habit back up in high school after not smoking in the group home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I began to turn all this around when I turned 18.  I inherited about 12k from my mother&amp;#39;s settlement. (She was, ironically, killed by a drunk driver).  I bought a car and started working.  Doing day labor mostly, but I loved it.  I had a falling out with a sister (one of RT&amp;#39;s daughters) who I was living with, threw a brick through her window, and voila! Got my own place.  I loved it.  In the worst part of town, with 1 bowl, 1 spoon, 1 pillow, 1 plate, 1 cup, 1 fork... I loved it there.  It was mine.  I went back to school.  They had a night school self-study in a classroom program.  I discovered that if I took the &amp;quot;end of semester&amp;quot; exams and passed them they would credit me that class.  I did 3-4 classes a day.  I also took the GED to knock off about 10 of the 22 required credits for my diploma.  I hadn&amp;#39;t passed a non-summer-school math class in 10 years.  Any class at all in 4.  I scored in the 99th percentile in Math, Reading, and Writing.  Literally teaching myself the math while taking the exams.  I totally, really, used to be smart, really.  I did 4 years of high school in 4 weeks.  I graduated on time.  I started community college after that, at the urging of every person that could speak to me during that time.  I didn&amp;#39;t have the passion for it, and quit.  I started and quit another two times.  School just never in the cards for me.  Since then, I&amp;#39;ve worked.  And worked.  I&amp;#39;ve always been a good worker.  Had about 10 different jobs, quitting a bunch due to disinterest or some floating moment of life that got me to move states briefly.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a daughter.  Went through a nasty custody battle.  Lost.  Me and the mother get along a lot better now, though.  I&amp;#39;m a pretty good father.  A little impatient and inattentive at times, but overall a good one.  I have another one on the way with a great woman, though she has her flaws like anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a great job.  I wait tables, work 4 days a week, and make ~70k a year.  I&amp;#39;ve been working in the same casino more than 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m objectively a success.  Everyone is so proud of me.  I&amp;#39;m the first man in my (adopted) family to graduate high school.  I make more money than anyone in any of my social circles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am absolutely fucking miserable.  I&amp;#39;m a failure.  I&amp;#39;m only successful because I&amp;#39;m a tall, intelligent, good looking, charismatic white male who is so afraid of being poor again that I will do my damndest to make sure I will never be.  I&amp;#39;m worthless.  I should be great.  I will never impact the world.  I am just another fucking cog in a machine run by shitty fucking people who were given everything to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tore my knee in two places while playing basketball.  Basketball has always been my reprieve.  Since I was 13, actually.  At the worst moments in my life I just go shoot.  For hours.  3, 4 hours.  Just shooting.  I&amp;#39;m now going to have to cut back, after having my meniscus removed.  I haven&amp;#39;t played since last August.  I have been out of work for a month, and taken to betting NBA more seriously.  It&amp;#39;s my dream to quit my job and bet it for a living.  I think I can do it (with more capital, of course).  I am currently failing horribly at it.  I am not intelligent anymore.  I have devolved into an idiot.  Drink.  I have picked Dota back up.  I am terrible now.  Because I&amp;#39;m an idiot.  Drink.  I have no talents.  The only thing I&amp;#39;m remotely good at is sex.  I&amp;#39;ve been with my girlfriend a year and a half now.  The &amp;quot;being impressive&amp;quot; stage is gone.  So I don&amp;#39;t even have that left.  Big Drink.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am resentful.  I am resentful to the point I became abusive in my last relationship.  Jealous of her &amp;quot;perfect life&amp;quot;.  Her loving parents.  Her friends.  Her special fucking bonds with people.  I hate myself.  I tell myself, instinctually, how much I hate myself every day.  I hate my brother (RT&amp;#39;s grandson, it&amp;#39;s a mess but it makes sense to us) because he had two parents who loved him and was the most spoiled of us all.  His mother died when he was 11.  He couldn&amp;#39;t handle it.  Now he&amp;#39;s jobless, living off some ghetto white chick (my adopted family is all half black, half mexican) and having another kid.  They have 4 now (and she has another, older one).  He has run the streets his whole life, being a thug, etc etc.  (My family is largely of the same ilk.  I&amp;#39;m the square, though I wasn&amp;#39;t always above similar behavior when I was younger.)  And now he&amp;#39;s a drug addict.  He&amp;#39;s smart, charismatic, good looking.  He&amp;#39;s fucking crazy.  He&amp;#39;s basically the black version of me.  He is the only person I feel I can actually relate to on this stuff.  I looked to him yesterday... and he absolutely let me down.  He doesn&amp;#39;t get it, he&amp;#39;s another spoiled child.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am so damn resentful it&amp;#39;s destroying me.  I am arrogant, and impressively self-loathing.  I deserve the world, and I am worthless.  Everyone that I&amp;#39;ve ever trusted has let me down.  No one has ever truly loved me.  Everyone that loves me is an idiot for thinking that much of me.  I&amp;#39;m an alcoholic.  I have a crippling gambling problem that sucks up every dollar after I pay bills or buy some shit I don&amp;#39;t need.  I need professional help.  I was seeing therapists at 8.  Again at 11, 13, 15, 18, 20, 25.  I was prescribed anti-depressants at 13.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want help.  I have come to the realization that I am more comfortable being a depressed wreck than I am otherwise.  This is who I am as a person.  I can&amp;#39;t quit drinking.  Who am I if I am not an alcoholic.  Who am I if I&amp;#39;m not spiraling out of control every few months.  I live for this.  I live to do well for 3 months, building future plans, working out, being a good man.  Then I crash.  Excessive drinking, gambling.  Being a piece of shit to my girlfriend.  Neglecting my daughter.  And then picking it all back up.  Refocused.  Recommitted.  What will I do if I don&amp;#39;t have this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how I&amp;#39;ll live the rest of my life if I don&amp;#39;t have this.  I need my depression.  I hate myself for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was much longer than I even anticipated.  If anyone actually reads this entire thing, thank you for taking the time to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really hope this post is ok here.  I&amp;#39;m not too versed on how this sub operates.
