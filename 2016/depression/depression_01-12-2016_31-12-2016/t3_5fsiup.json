It was like being stuck on repeat with an annoying pop song; every day the same nonstop self-hatred about falling behind my peers in high school, both socially and academically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    At the time, around 2014, I was 17 going on 18, and needless to say life just wasn&amp;#39;t cutting it for me. My parents were in the tailspin of what the judge in their divorce case apparently called, &amp;quot;one of the worse divorce cases she had seen in the state of Florida,&amp;quot; (and yes, we&amp;#39;re talking Florida here so you know there had to have been some pretty serious mudslinging involved). My mom had to split with my dad in 2012, He had lost his small Interior Design company during the crash of 08&amp;#39;, and ever since than had costed off odd jobs and my mother\u2019s meager salary working as an accountant for a small shipping company that did contracting work for the big boys over in Lockheed Martin, Boeing, ect..\n\n  Before the crash, life had been relatively simple growing up. I lived in a nice, quaint little neighborhood situated in the endless sea of suburbia that is the greater Orlando area. Trees were a common feature in-between the houses. My backyard had about an acre of old Florida; the palm and pine trees still clinging to their roots while the march of the developers had begun to sweep the surrounding area. My neighborhood, if it had anything going for it, was more authentic. My childhood memories consisted of man-hunt into the late hours of the night, frolicking around with our dads&amp;#39; expensive off-road toys during the day, and family dinner as the routine break in the middle. School had started out as an afterthought for me. It was just the job I had during the day where I would show up to an office space, impress my teachers with the ability to read books that were &amp;quot;way above the average reading-level&amp;quot;, and then go home and half-ass those boring math work-sheets I was given so I could jump on the PlayStation as quickly as possible. It was a sweet time to be alive, and for the price of total naivety, I could enjoy the childhood given to me by my always attentive mother, and my energetic but demanding father. That all changed around 2008. \n\n   As if on cue, the housing bubble finally popped around the time I entered middle school. My father, a fervent Republican his whole life, initially didn&amp;#39;t want to &amp;quot;buy in&amp;quot; to the crap he was hearing in the news, even though my mother tried warning him about possible difficulties ahead. She may not have been the smartest tool in the shed, but at least she was living in reality and could see the writing on the wall for my dad&amp;#39;s company. My parents had always been the type that thought that whoever had the loudest voice should be heard, but once my mom had to start carrying a hefty load for our family of five, the heated arguments became way more frequent. The typical routine was to go in my room and try to ignore anything I was hearing, the hateful insults and drunken slurs that started accompanying them more often. At the time, i just assumed it was typical family drama, and despite the intense outbursts of violence the dust always seemed to settle, and life could resume in my merry little world. \n\n However as time progressed and my family&amp;#39;s living situation deteriorated, it was clear my ultimate fear was going to be realized. The big, dreaded divorce finally had to happen. Our house, which my dad had spent countless hours and money trying to renovate, was in bad shape. The roof needed replacing, and we had to file for bankruptcy while the house was on the verge of being foreclosed. The only thing that provided me solace from all this was goofing around with my neighborhood buddies, middle school itself was pretty terrible. I went from being the funny, smart-ass kid that was pretty well-liked from my teachers to a cog in the machine that is public schooling. A highly valued cog still, because my test scores were really high or whatever. But by the time high school came around i was already beginning to fall behind academically. There was an intense amount of pressure to always be in the most advanced classes the school offered, even when I repeatedly kept failing my math classes. You see, I always was a bit of an outcast socially. I had friends here and there that I would talk to, but I never belong to any particular group of buddies.  I was really shy, and kids in school, especially the dreaded \u201cstandard kids\u201d were eager to pick on my weakness.  So, even though I was failing some classes and my GPA kept going downhill, I stuck through all the IB and AP classes that were available. Some of them I was able to do well in, mainly the history and government classes, but for the rest I just kind of slugged through. Besides, half of my teachers didn\u2019t give a shit about their job, and just regurgitated the \u201cSunshine State Standards\u201d playbook given to them so they could get their beloved pensions when they retired.  \n\n  The Divorce was brutal. I initially had to go back and forth with my two younger brothers between the nice new house that my mom had started renting out, and to my beloved old home that my dad was still living in (despite having technically lost it to the bank). I hated that, and my natural teenage angst was really kicking in at the time, so I decided to be my own person and move in full-time with my mother. My dad, despite always claiming to want to be involved in my life, has never stopped secretly hating me for that decision. It resulted in him having to pay some child-support to my mom, and he would always lament to me whenever I visited him about how he \u201cCouldn\u2019t believe I would fall for my mother\u2019s sick lies.\u201d Lies? What Lies I would wonder. I was a smart kid, and I knew that both my parents had made some mistakes in the past, but I just wanted to move past the whole thing. I tried being the family mediator between my mom and my dad. My mom would come home from her job in tears a lot of the time, we we\u2019re living with food stamps at the time and it was pretty hard for my mom to make ends-meat while simultaneously having to pay for a years-long divorce battle.  My dad had gotten a new job as an RV salesman, and was doing a pretty good job for himself I guess. But I would never hear it from him.  He was apparently \u201cstruggling\u201d to pay my mom her greedy child support money and to pay for his lawyers of course. Eventually, even though he could no longer afford paying for his lawyer, he finished the divorce proceedings representing himself (he is so stubborn).  \n\n  So as all of this progressed, I became more and more disillusioned with everything around me.  I thought that since my mom was an emotional wreck at the time, that maybe my dad\u2019s claims were actually true.  Maybe she was a crazy, coke-addict bitch. Maybe she did cheat on him with her best friends. Maybe she was all about hording as much money and stuff for herself.  I eventually started feeling super crazy myself, so I decided to give my dad a shot, and moved in with him. Absolutely nothing changed.  If anything, I started feeling worse.  There was a lot of pressure now to start kicking shit in gear, I was about to finish my junior year of high school.  I needed to get a job since my parents couldn\u2019t pay for any of my shit, and my college fund had gone out the window. Hard to get a job when you\u2019re lying in bed hating yourself all day.  I was getting tons of mail from universities since my PSAT scores were really high, but I knew with my GPA I was destined for the local community college. Ehhh.  I had a breakdown, wound up in a mental clinic for a night, and after that I decided to take up my distant Aunts offer to live with her in Park City, Utah for my senior year of high school. I\u2019ve already rambled on too long to describe that affair, but basically for the six months I lived there, WEED / SEX.  After my aunt had some financial mishaps herself, coupled with my lack of effort in school, I got shipped back home to mom\u2019s house again. And I\u2019ve been here slowly dying ever since. \n\n Now I\u2019m currently wasting away, smoking pot and going to work at my shitty retail job for 20 hours a week.  I really feel absolutely dead inside.  I hate everything, but I especially hate myself. I\u2019m a lazy, liberal piece of shit who leeches of my mom while she struggles to get by.  I can\u2019t sleep. I can barely eat, I\u2019ve lost a lot of weight.  I\u2019m at my wits end. Well, before I moved it was just a bunch of crazy thoughts swirling around my head. Now it\u2019s just nothing. I\u2019m a shell of my former self. I don\u2019t even think I liked who my former self was anyways; I took things for granted and thought I knew it all. I just don\u2019t know what to do. I think logically, I should kill myself. But my mom couldn\u2019t live with that. God damn it, if you read all of this I will give you medal, but that will not mean much. \n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I haven't posted on this sub in a while, that last time I did I was in a pretty dark place where my thoughts were constantly whirling in my head.
