New to this subreddit. Long-time dysthymic, recently been going through major depression for the past 2-4 months. Now I am three weeks on Wellbutrin and it has been AMAZING so far.

I was spending 3-4 days every week just lying in bed.

Being around my parents can be stressful in itself, and since I live in a really touristy city, we were running around doing stuff every day. And I&amp;#39;ve been working, launching a brand new project and trying to catch up with\u007f work that I let go of when I was bedridden. i put in 12 hours the other day, one of the days that I stayed in while my parents did their own thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the last day my parents were in town, I felt awful. Dehydrated, headache, tired and cranky and just...awful. I lay in bed the second I got home, ordered some junk food, and basically stayed in bed until this afternoon. I had headaches this morning, too. I took my meds as usual but I just feel SO unmotivated...I have work I really should do, but thinking of doing it is making me cringe inside.

I know the Wellbutrin can take up to 8 weeks to kick in, and it&amp;#39;s been great so far, but lots of people say they have ups/downs on it when they start taking it. I really can&amp;#39;t afford to take too many days off from my work (I&amp;#39;m a writer and I need to make my deadlines or I can&amp;#39;t pay rent.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even know what I expect in terms of a response...just advice?
