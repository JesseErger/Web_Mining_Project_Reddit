I found [a similar question](https://www.quora.com/Is-time-travel-possible-27?share=1) asked elsewhere, so the answer there might help you:\n\n&gt;Time travel to the past is impossible for many reasons, not least of which because there's nowhere to travel to. . .  \n\n&gt; The past and future don't exist in the same way as the present. .  \n\n&gt; Western society has a mental model of time as being a line that we travel along, and it makes intuitive sense that we could jump around on a line. . .  \n\n&gt; But reality is just a single point on that imaginary timeline. . .  \n\n&gt; The only thing that \"exists\" in a physical sense is the now. .  \n\n&gt; All the mass and energy and information keeps going along as the present, with nothing left behind.  \n\n&gt; . . The \"past\" is just a mental convenience that helps us understand cause and effect between different states of the present, not a place we can go to.  \n\n&gt; . . The past stops existing, except in memory, when it stops being the now.  \n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; Time makes a lot more sense when you stop using the ancient (and scientifically baseless) concepts of time as a line or a circle or a cycle. . . . Time is nothing more or less than the way we express rates of change.  \n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; It is a conceptual invention that corresponds to the technology of tracking the way physical systems change relative to each other. . . . A clock uses physics to maintain and measure a consistent rate, which we then compare to other rates.  \n\n&gt; . . The \"second\" or \"hour\" or \"year 1942\" have no physical significance except that we have defined arbitrary ratios of the number of times X happens per number of times Y happens. .  \n\n&gt; We measure those ratios and tally up the number of times they occur after some arbitrary reference and call that time.  \n\n&gt; . . The possibility of paradoxes within a theory -- such as traveling back in time to kill your \"past-self\" -- is excellent reason to believe that theory is flawed.  \n\n&gt; . . We can come up with any number of logical impossibilities if we think of time as a line that we can jump around on, or even just move in the wrong direction.  \n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; That is what makes it a bad theory. . . . The alternative is difficult to grasp at first.  \n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; We tend to think \"rate\" is a mathematical concept produced by dividing the physical property of change by the physical property of time, but that's backwards. . . . Time is a mathematical concept derived from change and rate.  \n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; Rates of change are fundamental properties of the physical world, and distances/states/changes are fundamental properties of the physical world, but time is the imaginary thing that we get when we divide one by the other. . . . Because of this fundamental dependence on rates, a form of \"time travel\" into the future is possible even though travel to the past is not.  \n\n&gt; . . The Theory of Relativity tells us that the local rate at which reality changes actually varies depending on the local energy density (expressed by curvature of space-time). .  \n\n&gt; The \"now\" doesn't have to change everywhere at the same underlying rate! That's a marvelously unintuitive fact that required extensive experimental evidence before it was widely accepted.  \n\n&gt; . . But we know it's true -- for example your GPS requires corrections for this fact or it wouldn't work right.  \n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; The clocks in the satellites advance at a slightly different rate than the clocks on Earth. . . . The effect is minuscule, but it's measurable.  \n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; Astronauts age at an infinitesimally slower rate while they're in space. . .  \n\n&gt; We can create a larger effect by increasing the energies/velocities. .  \n\n&gt; A clock on a rocket ship traveling near the speed of light will tick much slower than an identical clock on Earth.  \n\n&gt; . . To a person on the rocket, apparent time passes normally, because their biological processes and perceptions slow down just as much as the clock. . .  \n\n&gt; The underlying rate at which reality progresses/changes slows on the rocket ship relative to everyone back on Earth. .  \n\n&gt; So a person on the rocket can return to Earth and he will have aged less than the people who stayed at home -- he could end up younger than his twin who stayed behind! It appears as if he travelled into the future, without ever leaving the now.  \n\n&gt; . . This is where conceptions of time as a line really fall apart, but conceptions of time as the local rate underlying an \"ever-changing now\" work perfectly.  \n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; There is no unique \"reference time. . .  \n\n&gt;\" There are just relative differences in rates. . .  \n\n&gt; So the \"forward rate of change\" can vary, which lets you \"travel to the future\" in a sense by slowing down your own fundamental rate of change relative to everyone else's. .  \n\n&gt; But the local rate can never go negative. . .  \n\n&gt; According to Relativity, the rate at which clocks advance slows as the clock approaches the speed of light (or infinite local energy) but it's impossible for anything with mass to actually reach the speed of light. . . . Massless particles (such as photons) travel at the speed of light and do not \"subjectively experience\" the passing of any time at all -- to a photon, when it leaves a light source it instantaneously arrives at its destination.  \n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; But there is no solution to the equations of Relativity that have speeds faster than light or time running in reverse for any type of mass/energy that we have observed. . . . It's a \"square root of a negative number\" type mathematical construct with no physical interpretation.  \n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; So it doesn't make any mathematical sense for the local rate to go in reverse. . . . This is good, because running time in reverse would undo changes that already occurred, and this introduces the potential for all sorts of nasty paradoxes.  \n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; For example, if you get into a hypothetical time reversing machine and it reverses your local rate inside the machine, the first thing to happen will be \"rewinding\" you getting into the machine. . . . So you'll never make it any further back than your state at the moment you entered.  \n\n&gt; . . Reversing the local rate is fundamentally self-defeating and therefore could not result in time travel paradoxes even if it were possible.  \n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; Time is a difficult subject to understand, and our intuitive understanding of it very often does not match the physical reality that science has measured in the universe. . . . Time travel to the past is a perfect example of how an inaccurate mental model of time results in logical problems.  \n\n&gt; . . The proper solution is to change our conceptions of time away from the primitive concept of a continuum we travel along, and instead consider it as an expression of the underlying rate of change of the universe. .  .  \n\n^(I'm just a bot trying to share the love.

I found &lt;a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Is-time-travel-possible-27?share=1\"&gt;a similar question&lt;/a&gt; asked elsewhere, so the answer there might help you:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Time travel to the past is impossible for many reasons, not least of which because there&amp;#39;s nowhere to travel to. . .  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The past and future don&amp;#39;t exist in the same way as the present. .  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Western society has a mental model of time as being a line that we travel along, and it makes intuitive sense that we could jump around on a line. . .  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But reality is just a single point on that imaginary timeline. . .  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing that &amp;quot;exists&amp;quot; in a physical sense is the now. .  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the mass and energy and information keeps going along as the present, with nothing left behind.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;. . The &amp;quot;past&amp;quot; is just a mental convenience that helps us understand cause and effect between different states of the present, not a place we can go to.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;. . The past stops existing, except in memory, when it stops being the now.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Time makes a lot more sense when you stop using the ancient (and scientifically baseless) concepts of time as a line or a circle or a cycle. . . . Time is nothing more or less than the way we express rates of change.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is a conceptual invention that corresponds to the technology of tracking the way physical systems change relative to each other. . . . A clock uses physics to maintain and measure a consistent rate, which we then compare to other rates.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;. . The &amp;quot;second&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;hour&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;year 1942&amp;quot; have no physical significance except that we have defined arbitrary ratios of the number of times X happens per number of times Y happens. .  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We measure those ratios and tally up the number of times they occur after some arbitrary reference and call that time.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;. . The possibility of paradoxes within a theory -- such as traveling back in time to kill your &amp;quot;past-self&amp;quot; -- is excellent reason to believe that theory is flawed.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;. . We can come up with any number of logical impossibilities if we think of time as a line that we can jump around on, or even just move in the wrong direction.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is what makes it a bad theory. . . .
