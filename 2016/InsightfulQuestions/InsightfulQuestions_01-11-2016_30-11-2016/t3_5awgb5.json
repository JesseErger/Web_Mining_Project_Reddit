The success of a democracy depends on how well informed the electorate is about important issues. If your voters are ignorant about the issues they are voting on or, even worse, if they have deliberately been given misinformation then they can&amp;#39;t make good decisions. This isn&amp;#39;t just a problem for democracy, if you have a oligarchy with leaders who don&amp;#39;t know what they are doing they will not be able to govern well either (although obviously it is easier to educate a small group of people than an entire populous.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "InsightfulQuestions", "name": "t1_d9k8sb9", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/InsightfulQuestions/comments/5awgb5/are_democracies_becoming_too_democratic/d9k8sb9/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1478223316.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1478194516.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/InsightfulQuestions", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2smsq", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 12, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5awgb5", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": null, "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2smsq", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 6, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5awgb5", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": null, "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2smsq", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5awgb5", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d9knpgc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Potss", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d9kcrb5", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt; Elected leaders are acting populist.\n\n\nYou clearly have no idea how politicians actually behave.
