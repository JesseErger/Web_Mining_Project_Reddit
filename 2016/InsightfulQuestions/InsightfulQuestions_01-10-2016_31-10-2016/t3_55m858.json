Although this is not surprising in itself, the \u201cBell Syndrome\u201d is. Students on this campus must become cognizance [sic] of the fact that those students that succumb to the \u201cBell Syndrome\u201d has facilitated others to escape. Those students which pass a course satisfactorily should be aware that individual achievement alone did not accomplish this. In part, it was accomplished at the expense of other students to the \u201cBell Syndrome.\u201d Moreover, it should be obvious that one way to increase admissions to the University without necessarily increasing the total population of the University is to enforce the bell shape distribution of grades. This will ultimately take its toll of college students. The goals of education has become obfuscated at the high school level and this is manifested as high school \u201cdrop outs.\u201d Likewise at the college level, students that succumb to the \u201cBell Syndrome\u201d are college \u201cput outs.\u201d The inoculation against the \u201cBell Syndrome\u201d will necessitate an all out effort on the part of all students to ensure no one falls victim of it. Tolerance of the \u201cBell Syndrome\u201d only perpetuate the existing system. Students that confess to greater involvement in the community-at-large are only deluding themselves because of their continued tolerance of the \u201cBell Syndrome.\u201d Has it not occurred to students that some of the constituents of the community may comprise victims of the \u201cBell Syndrome\u201d which facilitate a greater chasm in relationship than already exist. If students cannot relate to other students, how can they relate to the community. Students must not allow the umbra of the \u201cBell Syndrome\u201d to abort the self-determination of fellow students.\n\n&gt; Lanham, Richard. Style: An Anti-Textbook (p. 39). Paul Dry Books. Kindle Edition. \n\nThe above, quoted from an undergrad's letter to a student newspaper, clearly makes no damned sense at all.  The student is imitating what he/she thinks is insightful writing but does not have a grasp of the words themselves.  He/she does not know what they *mean*.\n\nI find it quite funny that the textbooks that are never read, the ones that are a complete waste of money but for the assignments required and contained therein, are the undergrad English composition textbooks.  Having seen a few recent examples of them I can guess why students don't read them.  They're awful.  They're fully of silly suggestions that no one does or will do. \n\nFor instance one I saw last year had a whole section suggesting that students go get a poster board and make a collage of what they wanted to write a paper about, that they could tape pictures to that represented themes in the paper. Then they could rearrange the pictures to help as an outline. Clearly the author of that textbook has no grasp of the fact that students these days don't have magazines to cut up.  Students read on their tablets and laptops, they only see printed material in the school library if there's no other option for research purposes. \n\nI have my theories on this as well but more research would be required to prove my theories on the matter.  The most simple of which is that english/literature departments are full of people who are distinctly not technologically inclined and have resisted the digital age.  In so doing they have decreased their relevance in the eyes of academia as a whole and the whole is suffering for it.\n\n&gt; So my response would be that we should reconsider the requirements we have for ourselves and our children. We should learn to use technology to convey meaning effectively, not the perpetuate outdated rules of punctuation. Where rules still provide meaning, maintain them. Where rules are superseded, ignore them and don't worry if they are replaced.\n\nHere's where we are starting to agree, I think.  Ironically, the first thing students in higher education pursuing creative writing have to learn is to un-learn all of the academic writing skills that they have attained over the past 13 to 15 years of school, otherwise their creative writing starts to sound like a government manual (just as their academic writing does).

Although this is not surprising in itself, the \u201cBell Syndrome\u201d is. Students on this campus must become cognizance [sic] of the fact that those students that succumb to the \u201cBell Syndrome\u201d has facilitated others to escape. Those students which pass a course satisfactorily should be aware that individual achievement alone did not accomplish this. In part, it was accomplished at the expense of other students to the \u201cBell Syndrome.\u201d Moreover, it should be obvious that one way to increase admissions to the University without necessarily increasing the total population of the University is to enforce the bell shape distribution of grades. This will ultimately take its toll of college students. The goals of education has become obfuscated at the high school level and this is manifested as high school \u201cdrop outs.\u201d Likewise at the college level, students that succumb to the \u201cBell Syndrome\u201d are college \u201cput outs.\u201d The inoculation against the \u201cBell Syndrome\u201d will necessitate an all out effort on the part of all students to ensure no one falls victim of it. Tolerance of the \u201cBell Syndrome\u201d only perpetuate the existing system. Students that confess to greater involvement in the community-at-large are only deluding themselves because of their continued tolerance of the \u201cBell Syndrome.\u201d Has it not occurred to students that some of the constituents of the community may comprise victims of the \u201cBell Syndrome\u201d which facilitate a greater chasm in relationship than already exist. If students cannot relate to other students, how can they relate to the community. Students must not allow the umbra of the \u201cBell Syndrome\u201d to abort the self-determination of fellow students.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lanham, Richard. Style: An Anti-Textbook (p. 39). Paul Dry Books. Kindle Edition. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The above, quoted from an undergrad&amp;#39;s letter to a student newspaper, clearly makes no damned sense at all.  The student is imitating what he/she thinks is insightful writing but does not have a grasp of the words themselves.  He/she does not know what they &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find it quite funny that the textbooks that are never read, the ones that are a complete waste of money but for the assignments required and contained therein, are the undergrad English composition textbooks.  Having seen a few recent examples of them I can guess why students don&amp;#39;t read them.  They&amp;#39;re awful.  They&amp;#39;re fully of silly suggestions that no one does or will do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance one I saw last year had a whole section suggesting that students go get a poster board and make a collage of what they wanted to write a paper about, that they could tape pictures to that represented themes in the paper. Then they could rearrange the pictures to help as an outline. Clearly the author of that textbook has no grasp of the fact that students these days don&amp;#39;t have magazines to cut up.  Students read on their tablets and laptops, they only see printed material in the school library if there&amp;#39;s no other option for research purposes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have my theories on this as well but more research would be required to prove my theories on the matter.  The most simple of which is that english/literature departments are full of people who are distinctly not technologically inclined and have resisted the digital age.  In so doing they have decreased their relevance in the eyes of academia as a whole and the whole is suffering for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So my response would be that we should reconsider the requirements we have for ourselves and our children. We should learn to use technology to convey meaning effectively, not the perpetuate outdated rules of punctuation. Where rules still provide meaning, maintain them. Where rules are superseded, ignore them and don&amp;#39;t worry if they are replaced.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s where we are starting to agree, I think.  Ironically, the first thing students in higher education pursuing creative writing have to learn is to un-learn all of the academic writing skills that they have attained over the past 13 to 15 years of school, otherwise their creative writing starts to sound like a government manual (just as their academic writing does). Given the assumption that there is a large gap between creative writing and academic writing, we must judge one or the other &amp;#39;wrong&amp;#39; for lack of a better word.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of room for academic writing to adapt to the times, but they don&amp;#39;t have to lower standards to do it, in my opinion.
