I know some people who will never be able to drink socially because they dont know when to stop they completely lose control over it ... and it can happen to you very quickly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These days ...... I NEVER drink when I am feeling depressed - I don&amp;#39;t drink alone ... unless its like a glass of wine while I&amp;#39;m cooking  (I use to drink a 30 pack of beer and a fifth of booze a day so I&amp;#39;ve dramatically turned around) I no longer hang out with people who ONLY do activities involving drinking ... You are still young and going through those prime drinking years so you are going to find everyone drinks and it seems like its always a drinking activity but try to maintain a balance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you ever have any questions or anything feel free to contact me --- keep fighting the good fight. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "ptsd", "name": "t1_cyi64uj", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ptsd/comments/3yzzfv/alcohol_and_ptsd/cyi64uj/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1451667096.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1451638296.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ptsd", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm0x", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3yzzfv", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": null, "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm0x", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3yzzfv", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": null, "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm0x", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3yzzfv", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": null, "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm0x", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3yzzfv", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cyi5m6g", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SoTheyDontFindOut", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cyi5jud", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Well I guess antipsychotic is different which I don't doubt.
