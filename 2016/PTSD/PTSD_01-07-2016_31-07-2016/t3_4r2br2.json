My symptoms have been getting worse especially the past 6 months or so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking as a psych student, yeah, this makes sense. With PTSD, you are often in a constant state of heightened anxiety/sort of in &amp;quot;fight or flight&amp;quot; mode 24/7. That leads to what many of us here are familiar with, hypervigilantism. That can lead to being easily startled by sudden movements, sounds etc. (a lot of it is often confused for OCD symptoms, such as constantly checking locks on doors for safety, or being aware of all exits at all times etc.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short, yes, what you&amp;#39;re experiencing can certainly be a normal/usual symptom of any form of PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "ptsd", "name": "t1_d4xy2gq", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ptsd/comments/4r2br2/anyone_else_with_noncombat_related_ptsd_not_able/d4xy2gq/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1467602242.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1467573442.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ptsd", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm0x", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 10, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4r2br2", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d4xs8zx", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wittyish", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_4r2br2", "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Anything that raises my biological stress factors (loud noises, lack of sleep, even a recent surprise part in my honor) immediately pushes me into anxiety, and all anxiety feels the same to me.
