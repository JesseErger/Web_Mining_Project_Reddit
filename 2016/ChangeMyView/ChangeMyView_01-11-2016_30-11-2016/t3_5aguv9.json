The comparison I&amp;#39;m making is that going from unicelular to multicellular life is a massive step.  It took a fraction of the time to go from multicellular to land plant, and from land plant to high intelligent life.

A bacteria? They may be equally unable to talk to us even if they wanted to.

One of the most common criticisms of what I've been saying this entire thread is something along these lines:  \"To us, building a space station might be a huge accomplishment.  But to aliens that can travel between dimensions, that's nothing.  Maybe traveling between dimensions is their metric for intelligence\".  And that's what I object to.

Can you teach a severely mentally handicapped human (IQ &lt; 20) quantum physics? No, because he is not intelligent enough. Intelligence is a scale, not an absolute. If an alien child could learn in a month what it takes a human to learn in a lifetime - in addition to having the innate ability to apply that knowledge, then would it consider you intelligent? A child like version of itself? No, it would consider you to be a very basic, dumb, version of sentient life. It couldn't even express higher ideas to you because you are not intelligent and are not physically capable of being so compared to itself.\n\nI agree with your very first sentence.  But your analogy with the alien child is very flawed.  \n\nIntelligence is a scale, yes, but it's also binary in a sense.  There is a trigger point, a flash point if you will, where evolution gave the species a brain so well crafted that the possible creations it could conceive of include inventions or creations that would augment or amplify its own intelligence, thus freeing it from the constraints of evolution.  \n\nAn ant has to wait for evolution to increase its intelligence, *if* it even increases its intelligence.  A monkey does too.  Everything on earth is completely at the whims of evolution, except humans.  Evolution gave humans a mind, where the intelligence ceiling is more than high enough for humans to craft devices to augment our own intelligence.  But before that, human knowledge itself is a way to amplify intelligence.  If you had dropped Einstein in 5000 BC, he would not have come up with relativity, because he lacked the intelligence amplifier that was all human knowledge.  But if you place him in the 1900s, with access to all human knowledge up to that point, he was able to contribute relativity to the pile.  He wasn't able to do that without the intelligence amplifier that is the accumulation of knowledge passed down generation to generation. \n\nAll of mankind's advances have come from this accumulation of knowledge approach.  We haven't actually implanted chips in our minds to multiply our intelligence, but that is going to be happening soon.  Within the next century, maybe two tops.  And that's my point about this whole thread.  Aliens would be able to identify this trajectory of exponentially increasing intelligence.  That's why intelligence is binary.  Either a species has this exponential increasing intelligence, or it doesn't.  The ones that do are deemed \"intelligent\" because they will one day reach the super intelligent species, and the ones that don't are considered unintelligent because they are stuck in the environment on their planet, completely at the mercy of evolution.  \n\n&gt; Yes there was some path to get there, and no it does not have to go through ours.\n\nI agree.  But I meant it more generically than you seemed to understand.  I don't mean go through the growing pains that our civilization is going through.
