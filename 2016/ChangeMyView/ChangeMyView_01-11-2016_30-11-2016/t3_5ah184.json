You have to have administrative staff to evaluate revenues and expenses under your new program and determine the budget each individual department is allowed to have. This will be more or less efficient directly correlating with how much you spend. If you spend more you can have it nuanced to each department, if you spend less you can have a small federal committee set the budget nationally, this would in turn lead to more inefficiency as not every district will have the exact same needs, but will get the good ole government standardization to save time, which leads to wasted resources.\n\n2.) You have to hire additional staff to facilitate every account. That's not just people in repayment, that's people incurring costs, people who need time to discuss their accounts and people who need to set up payment plans and so on. This is as small as 2 accountants per district with no upper limit because some districts are larger than others and may need additional staff to facilitate the amount of accounts on hand. Realistically it's a very high number because the government has a duty to have high availability for things of this nature, which means that you can't have your only accountant take two weeks of vacation while Joe somebody is freaking out about going to jail because he can't work out his payment information.\n\n3.) You have to have staff to enforce your policies. That's people mailing off legal documents to recipients, making phone calls to set up appointments and people attempting to get payees to just show up. That's not starting repayment, that's getting them to show up to talk about repayment. Which means that this system is slow. Granted there can be some overlap with existing staff under our current system, however the additional infrastructure for this specific set of tasks will still require a global increase in personell because we are adding additional components that the government needs to be able to facilitate.\n\n4.) You have to give people heinous amounts of time to set up appointments and repayments. This increases the effective costs of parts 2&amp;3 because if a person takes their full 90 days to get into the welfare office and another 90 days to start making payments it leads to under utilization of those staff members which is a decrease in productivity and ultimately spending money to generate less revenue.\n\n5.) When people decide not to repay, you need staff that is going to make an appearance at their homes and an effort to keep your recouping costs as high as possible. Because if not, no small number of people are just gonna fall of the grid and you won't see any repayment for your investment into this system.\n\n\n6.) People are inevitably going to not pay. You likened it to not paying taxes which is an offense worth jail time if strung along far enough. You can say \"Well people breaking a law isn't a good reason not to have a law.\" But this is going to have a disproportionate effect on the poor. *There will* be an increase in people going to prison for this offense because it's currently set at 0. So for every person that sees prison time as a result of not paying back their food stamps, that's an average of $31,000 a year we just increased our debt by, instead of writing off the aid they received in the first place. What's more, you cannot rule out prison sentences for this as a possibility. People will have to go to jail for not paying back their food stamps because if they don't we have no basis to enforce people paying them back anyway. Your alternative to this is that we just write the aid off, but that would have automatically been cheaper if we hadn't hired that additional staff to get us to this point in the first place.\n\nSo to be conservative, we are adding roughly 5 staff members with a median wage of anywhere between $50,000-$70,000 plus a government benefits package per office to handle recouping costs. There are right around 20,000 cities in the united states, so assuming an average of 1 office per city (some cities will have 0 others will have 4) we are looking at no less than 5 billion dollars in just salaries. That's not including payroll taxes, nor is it including any of the previous externalities I've discussed. So just with that salaries figure alone, the break even point is right around 7% of what we spend. Which means that the maximum possible investment we could get out is less than 93%. Given that 35% of the population is on welfare, if just 3% of that defaults and goes to prison for a term of 1 year on average, we spend more sending them to jail (~93 billion) than we do writing them off on welfare. As I've said already, if you are going to make people repay, prison sentences *have* to be on the table otherwise we are simply left with food aid being cheaper to expense.", "edited": 1477984211.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay. let&amp;#39;s start from the top:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.) You have to have administrative staff to evaluate revenues and expenses under your new program and determine the budget each individual department is allowed to have. This will be more or less efficient directly correlating with how much you spend. If you spend more you can have it nuanced to each department, if you spend less you can have a small federal committee set the budget nationally, this would in turn lead to more inefficiency as not every district will have the exact same needs, but will get the good ole government standardization to save time, which leads to wasted resources.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.) You have to hire additional staff to facilitate every account. That&amp;#39;s not just people in repayment, that&amp;#39;s people incurring costs, people who need time to discuss their accounts and people who need to set up payment plans and so on. This is as small as 2 accountants per district with no upper limit because some districts are larger than others and may need additional staff to facilitate the amount of accounts on hand. Realistically it&amp;#39;s a very high number because the government has a duty to have high availability for things of this nature, which means that you can&amp;#39;t have your only accountant take two weeks of vacation while Joe somebody is freaking out about going to jail because he can&amp;#39;t work out his payment information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3.) You have to have staff to enforce your policies. That&amp;#39;s people mailing off legal documents to recipients, making phone calls to set up appointments and people attempting to get payees to just show up. That&amp;#39;s not starting repayment, that&amp;#39;s getting them to show up to talk about repayment. Which means that this system is slow. Granted there can be some overlap with existing staff under our current system, however the additional infrastructure for this specific set of tasks will still require a global increase in personell because we are adding additional components that the government needs to be able to facilitate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4.) You have to give people heinous amounts of time to set up appointments and repayments. This increases the effective costs of parts 2&amp;amp;3 because if a person takes their full 90 days to get into the welfare office and another 90 days to start making payments it leads to under utilization of those staff members which is a decrease in productivity and ultimately spending money to generate less revenue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5.) When people decide not to repay, you need staff that is going to make an appearance at their homes and an effort to keep your recouping costs as high as possible. Because if not, no small number of people are just gonna fall of the grid and you won&amp;#39;t see any repayment for your investment into this system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6.) People are inevitably going to not pay. You likened it to not paying taxes which is an offense worth jail time if strung along far enough. You can say &amp;quot;Well people breaking a law isn&amp;#39;t a good reason not to have a law.&amp;quot; But this is going to have a disproportionate effect on the poor. &lt;em&gt;There will&lt;/em&gt; be an increase in people going to prison for this offense because it&amp;#39;s currently set at 0. So for every person that sees prison time as a result of not paying back their food stamps, that&amp;#39;s an average of $31,000 a year we just increased our debt by, instead of writing off the aid they received in the first place. What&amp;#39;s more, you cannot rule out prison sentences for this as a possibility. People will have to go to jail for not paying back their food stamps because if they don&amp;#39;t we have no basis to enforce people paying them back anyway. Your alternative to this is that we just write the aid off, but that would have automatically been cheaper if we hadn&amp;#39;t hired that additional staff to get us to this point in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to be conservative, we are adding roughly 5 staff members with a median wage of anywhere between $50,000-$70,000 plus a government benefits package per office to handle recouping costs. There are right around 20,000 cities in the united states, so assuming an average of 1 office per city (some cities will have 0 others will have 4) we are looking at no less than 5 billion dollars in just salaries. That&amp;#39;s not including payroll taxes, nor is it including any of the previous externalities I&amp;#39;ve discussed.
