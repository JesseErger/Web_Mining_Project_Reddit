So, we have gender identity, gender expression, and gender roles. \n\n**Gender identity**, simply put, answers the question of who we are (in terms of gender, of course). For me, for example, this answer is, \"I am a woman.\" That's it. There's no special list of reasons or arguments that I have to use to support this claim. I am a woman, end of story. And we generally don't have this notion questioned ever, unless we're talking about trans issues. \n\n**Gender expression** is, as the name itself says, how we express that gender identity. This varies greatly, depending on a lot of different reasons. For example, in the west, dresses are considered to be feminine, but that's not the case across the globe. There are places where dresses (or clothing akin to dresses and skirts and the like) are regularly worn by men and it's one of the accepted kinds of gender expression there. Basically, those things that are traditionally considered feminine and masculine (dolls are for girls, cars for boys, pink for girls, blue for boys, etc) are a type of gender expression (and we know many people don't fall into these neat categories). \n\n**Gender roles** are how people are expected to behave in a given society based on, once again, their gender identity. Notice that the identity is a constant central point, and all other terms depend on it. Gender roles, of course, are things like men being the breadwinners and women being housewives, for example. \n\n--------------------------\n\nSo here's the problem with your view: \n\nA) You are against the promotion of traditional gender expressions and roles - this part is cool and no confusion yet \n\nB) You think trans people getting sex reassignment surgery goes against point A - this is where you're wrong\n\n---------------------\n\nTrans people's issue is that their gender *identity* doesn't match up with their body/genitals. And that's that central, \"Who you are,\" question. It's not a matter of wanting to wear pink or play with cars; it's about having your insides - your brain (and studies have shown that trans people's brains are more similar to the brains of the gender they identify with as opposed to the assigned one) - match the outside. A trans woman can have a sex reassignment surgery and still wear baggy clothes, work in construction, play with toy cars and guns, you name it. She can absolutely go against the normative gender expression and roles. The SRS has no bearing on that whatsoever. \n\nBasically, when I say that I am a woman, that in itself only answers the question of what my gender identity is. It doesn't tell you anything about my likes and dislikes, hobbies, clothing style, dream job, etc. \n\n----------------\n\n&gt; Note: someone who wants to transition because they feel their literal genatalia isn't right I completely understand. That is not my argument.\n\nand \n\n&gt; And by that logic I believe a person seeing themselves as a different sex, because they are aligned with the associated gender role, to be advancing the unethical concept of gender roles.\n\nSo basically, the conclusion here is that trans people *don't* transition because of gender roles or gender expression, but because of gender identity. So, essentially, you should have no issue with the concept. \n\n-----------------\n\nEdit for clarity ", "edited": 1477953242.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re confusing different terms here so let&amp;#39;s figure those out first. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When talking about any and all gender issues, there are certain terms that tend to get mixed up often that then leads to lots of confusion.

This varies greatly, depending on a lot of different reasons. For example, in the west, dresses are considered to be feminine, but that&amp;#39;s not the case across the globe. There are places where dresses (or clothing akin to dresses and skirts and the like) are regularly worn by men and it&amp;#39;s one of the accepted kinds of gender expression there. Basically, those things that are traditionally considered feminine and masculine (dolls are for girls, cars for boys, pink for girls, blue for boys, etc) are a type of gender expression (and we know many people don&amp;#39;t fall into these neat categories). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender roles&lt;/strong&gt; are how people are expected to behave in a given society based on, once again, their gender identity. Notice that the identity is a constant central point, and all other terms depend on it. Gender roles, of course, are things like men being the breadwinners and women being housewives, for example. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the problem with your view: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A) You are against the promotion of traditional gender expressions and roles - this part is cool and no confusion yet &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;B) You think trans people getting sex reassignment surgery goes against point A - this is where you&amp;#39;re wrong&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trans people&amp;#39;s issue is that their gender &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t match up with their body/genitals. And that&amp;#39;s that central, &amp;quot;Who you are,&amp;quot; question. It&amp;#39;s not a matter of wanting to wear pink or play with cars; it&amp;#39;s about having your insides - your brain (and studies have shown that trans people&amp;#39;s brains are more similar to the brains of the gender they identify with as opposed to the assigned one) - match the outside. A trans woman can have a sex reassignment surgery and still wear baggy clothes, work in construction, play with toy cars and guns, you name it. She can absolutely go against the normative gender expression and roles. The SRS has no bearing on that whatsoever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, when I say that I am a woman, that in itself only answers the question of what my gender identity is. It doesn&amp;#39;t tell you anything about my likes and dislikes, hobbies, clothing style, dream job, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Note: someone who wants to transition because they feel their literal genatalia isn&amp;#39;t right I completely understand. That is not my argument.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And by that logic I believe a person seeing themselves as a different sex, because they are aligned with the associated gender role, to be advancing the unethical concept of gender roles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So basically, the conclusion here is that trans people &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; transition because of gender roles or gender expression, but because of gender identity. So, essentially, you should have no issue with the concept. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit for clarity &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_d9g1949", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5afb3y/cmv_the_desire_to_get_a_sex_change_based_on/d9g1949/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1477981724.0, "author_flair_text": "21\u2206", "created_utc": 1477952924.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 5, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5afb3y", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5afb3y", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5afb3y", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5afb3y", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 5, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5afb3y", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5afb3y", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5afb3y", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d9g3vw9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DeltaBot", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d9g3ug2", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/TheOneRuler ([1\u2206](/r/changemyview/wiki/user/TheOneRuler)).\n\n^[Delta\u00a0System\u00a0Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)\n[\u200b](HTTP://DB3PARAMSSTART\n{\n  \"comment\": \"This is hidden text for DB3 to parse.

It's true that my first notions of gender came from the outside - that I was taught that I was a girl. Adults around me pointed me in that direction and, over the course of my childhood, impressed various different lessons and added meanings to this term \"girl\" or \"woman\". \n\nMore often than not, our initial understanding of gender does indeed come tightly connected to genitals (girls have vaginas and boys have penises) as well as traditional gender roles and expressions. The former because it's simple and the vast majority of people won't have an issue with this (if you're not trans, then your genitals do help in confirming your gender identity in a way) and the latter is a more complicated societal and cultural matter that I'd reduce to: it's simple and people pass on the knowledge and ideas that they themselves have and agree with.\n\nBut as we grow up, we sometimes move away from these initial notions. We learn new things and we find ourselves liking things that are outside that neat little girl or boy box. I, for example, never played with dolls. My idea of fun was running around with the boys in my neighborhood playing any and all sports, various \"war\" games, video games, you name it. That's where the divergence started. And in many ways it grew, though in some others I do fit into the traditional ways. Most people are a combination of the two, after all. \n\nAnd yet throughout this, I never stopped feeling like a woman. No matter what I did and was interested in, I was always a woman. I realized I wasn't straight and not for one second did I think, \"Gee, I'm attracted to women, maybe I'm actually a man.\" Nope, from the first moment it was clear that I was simply a woman that wasn't straight. \n\nAnd the list goes on. It's a feeling that comes from within. Our gender identity is based on the inside, in our brain, and not on what others tell us and what we like or dislike. There are other things that manifest on the outside that may make it seemingly murky (like expression and roles), but identity is the one constant that doesn't change, no matter what happens. And circling back to genitalia, if I lost mine in a freak accident tomorrow, I wouldn't all of a sudden identify as gender neutral. I would still be a woman. Genitals are one aspect of it, but far from being the only one. They do help immensely though, simply in terms of not having that disconnect between our brains and bodies.
