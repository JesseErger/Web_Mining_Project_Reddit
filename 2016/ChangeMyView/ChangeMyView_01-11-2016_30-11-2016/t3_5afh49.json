It was that while you might prefer one way to another, it's logically consistent to be concerned by the Senate if you're concerned by the EC--particularly if over/under-representation by certain states is a big thing that bugs you about the EC.\n\n&gt; In a Swing State, voting is different than in other states. In a Swing State, you vote for the candidate that \"can beat\" the candidate you like least, and it becomes illogical to vote third party, making transfers of power even more slow and unreasonable. Then in states that aren't swing states, it's actually reasonable to vote for who you really want, but you'll feel as if your vote is nullified more or less.\nBy discouraging voters in these ways, either making them feel responsible to vote for something they don't want or by making them feel as if their vote is nullified, we lower voter turnout.\nBut specifically what voters are the most discouraged and left out? The ones that don't fall under the Republican+Democrat system... And honestly, that's about half of voters being alienated. This isn't 45/45/10, where the majority actually supports these parties. It's a system where about half the people are disenfranchised and support neither, and we actually have minority rule while alienating the majority of voters.\nThat is, definitionally, not democracy. It leads to a system where the representatives/president do not support or represent the people.\n\nThis is all an argument for why the EC is less than ideal. That's fine. But I specifically say in my OP that I'm not interested in hearing why the EC is bad--I'm interested in hearing why the same flaws in the Senate aren't troubling.\n\nYour arguments to that end are (1) the average voter cares more about the presidency, and (2) it's possible for independents to occasionally make it to the Senate. 1 is totally irrelevant to our discussion. That's not a reason that the flaws of the EC matter more than the same flaws in the Senate; if anything it's probably the reason that so many people find the EC troubling but never consider the Senate in the same way. 2 is...only sort of true anyway, and Senate races hold all of the same incentives that presidential ones do...lesser of two evils and all that.", "edited": 1478027415.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;you give an, at best we don&amp;#39;t know or they&amp;#39;re equal response&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point I was trying to make wasn&amp;#39;t that they&amp;#39;re equal or we can&amp;#39;t say.

These 450 representatives would be allocated based on the party that people voted for (rounded down). For example, if the polls ended up with 40% Republican, 35% Democratic, 20% libertarian and 5% green, there would be 180 Republican representatives, 157 democratic, 90 libertarian,  and 22 green representatives. The remaining representatives (1 in this case) would then be allocated to the parties with the highest remainder at first (for example someone who&amp;#39;d get say 35.9 representatives would get first dibs over someone who had 37.5 representatives because .9 is larger than .5) , any second one would go to the one with the next highest remainder, etc. In the event of a tie, for example in this one where the both the democrats and the greens have a .5 remainder, it would go to the party with the greatest representation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This would fix a lot of the problems inherent with simple majorities and would break the 2 party stranglehold on America. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_d9g4o45", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5afh49/cmv_if_you_favor_abolishing_the_electoral_college/d9g4o45/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1477986612.0, "author_flair_text": "1\u2206", "created_utc": 1477957812.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5afh49", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5afh49", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d9h7mau", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "carlos_the_dwarf_", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d9h5x74", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt; First, the Senate and the Presidency differ in that there are 100 Senate Positions, but only one President.
