just provide an enjoyable melody or series of sounds that ocasionally inspires moods, thoughts or feelings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_d2ofieo", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/4h8m6l/cmv_a_space_odyssey_and_other_such_films_are/d2ofieo/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1462141949.0, "author_flair_text": "98\u2206", "created_utc": 1462113149.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4h8m6l", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4h8m6l", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4h8m6l", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4h8m6l", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4h8m6l", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4h8m6l", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4h8m6l", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4h8m6l", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2pbcwi", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gxwho", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d2pb1s1", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt;

After disarming the computer?\n\nI guess it comes down to arbitrariness. If it's just something outside his understanding, it could have shown Dave literally anything. But Stanley Kubrik decided to show Dave and the audience these certain images. I can't get around the fact that everything and anything shown from that point is all just random. The selection has a meaning. or more close meaning to certain interpretations over others.\n\nThat interpretation works too. Do you think it's somewhat of a cop-out? I mean it's valid and all, but when we try to evaluate interpretations over another, we give precedence to and say one interpretation is more valid than another if it explains more details, and there is more congruency with other details, just like science and logic. \n\nIf what happened outside of his perspective is so, then why the LSD trip? Wouldn't some sort of induced hallucination explain more details? \n\nIf some other explanation that covered things in more detail, for example his aging somehow being connected to Hal... idk... would be more valid than the hallucination interpretation.\n\nLike we say there is a theme of evolution because the movie opened with apes, and the mysterious black slab was there too, tying all phases of the movie (apes, present, and the aging scene). Therefore we say the evolution or species progress theme is more valid than the explanation of \"oh it's all a dream... since technically any movie can be considered a dream.\"\n\n___________\n\nUnreliable narrators in genera:\n\nThat's fine, it has some semblance in reality, as that's how every single one of us is going through life.\n\nWe can then apply our tools of reasoning and objective logic to figure out how things \"really\" are, according to the rules and physics of that fictional universe. But when the rules of the universe change within that film, without narration, and INCONSISTENTLY.... that's another thing.\n\nTo illustrate, maybe a special wizard casts a super forbidden spell that results in all magic being empty and nonexistent. That's still consistent with the physics of that fictional universe, since it was a spell that eliminates spells.\n\nBut if one moment, magic works, and then it doesn't, for no good reason, when they didn't even travel back into the earth world, and his wand is not broken, and he isn't mysteriously silenced by some unknown spell.... the physics has been broken.\n\n\n\nGetting back on point about unreliable narrators. The Shining does it, Fight club does it, and it's actually a common literary device used in micro-examples throughout various works. Naruto will show selective flashbacks of Gaara's past as he viewed it, with the same emotional undertones. Fine. It can be pieced together, and it can easily be inferred that it's from someone's perspective. This actually models reality, where we hear a rumor according to a person, and that creates a mental model of reality, then we go out and test and analyze that model. \nBut if it's just... things change and you don't know how to interpret it, and there is no way to pin down how to interpret it based on any of the other clues in the movie, then what are we watching? \n\nIf it's not supposed to make sense THEN TELL US IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO MAKE SENSE.\n\nThat's all I wish. I actually find the lack of such meta-information in normal social communication to be annoying too.

After disarming the computer?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it comes down to arbitrariness. If it&amp;#39;s just something outside his understanding, it could have shown Dave literally anything. But Stanley Kubrik decided to show Dave and the audience these certain images. I can&amp;#39;t get around the fact that everything and anything shown from that point is all just random. The selection has a meaning. or more close meaning to certain interpretations over others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That interpretation works too. Do you think it&amp;#39;s somewhat of a cop-out? I mean it&amp;#39;s valid and all, but when we try to evaluate interpretations over another, we give precedence to and say one interpretation is more valid than another if it explains more details, and there is more congruency with other details, just like science and logic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If what happened outside of his perspective is so, then why the LSD trip? Wouldn&amp;#39;t some sort of induced hallucination explain more details? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If some other explanation that covered things in more detail, for example his aging somehow being connected to Hal... idk... would be more valid than the hallucination interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like we say there is a theme of evolution because the movie opened with apes, and the mysterious black slab was there too, tying all phases of the movie (apes, present, and the aging scene). Therefore we say the evolution or species progress theme is more valid than the explanation of &amp;quot;oh it&amp;#39;s all a dream... since technically any movie can be considered a dream.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unreliable narrators in genera:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s fine, it has some semblance in reality, as that&amp;#39;s how every single one of us is going through life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can then apply our tools of reasoning and objective logic to figure out how things &amp;quot;really&amp;quot; are, according to the rules and physics of that fictional universe. But when the rules of the universe change within that film, without narration, and INCONSISTENTLY.... that&amp;#39;s another thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, maybe a special wizard casts a super forbidden spell that results in all magic being empty and nonexistent. That&amp;#39;s still consistent with the physics of that fictional universe, since it was a spell that eliminates spells.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if one moment, magic works, and then it doesn&amp;#39;t, for no good reason, when they didn&amp;#39;t even travel back into the earth world, and his wand is not broken, and he isn&amp;#39;t mysteriously silenced by some unknown spell.... the physics has been broken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Getting back on point about unreliable narrators. The Shining does it, Fight club does it, and it&amp;#39;s actually a common literary device used in micro-examples throughout various works. Naruto will show selective flashbacks of Gaara&amp;#39;s past as he viewed it, with the same emotional undertones. Fine. It can be pieced together, and it can easily be inferred that it&amp;#39;s from someone&amp;#39;s perspective. This actually models reality, where we hear a rumor according to a person, and that creates a mental model of reality, then we go out and test and analyze that model. \nBut if it&amp;#39;s just... things change and you don&amp;#39;t know how to interpret it, and there is no way to pin down how to interpret it based on any of the other clues in the movie, then what are we watching? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s not supposed to make sense THEN TELL US IT&amp;#39;S NOT SUPPOSED TO MAKE SENSE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all I wish. I actually find the lack of such meta-information in normal social communication to be annoying too.  People will say stuff like &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s inappropriate&amp;quot;, but what they actually mean is they think it&amp;#39;s inappropriate based on their working model of ethics, social norms, belief structure, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s illogical&amp;quot; when what they&amp;#39;re saying has nothing to do with logic, but rather a projected thing they personally value, and then assume the other person has the same goal and value, but take a different course of action not conducive to achieving that goal/value.

And at no point in time after the LSD trip did we ever get back to physics-obeying reality, something that would indicate that the entire thing isn't a hallucination, a dream, or anything like that. Who is to say that the entire LSD trip wasn't something the alien tech induced at that moment, and then everything after that was a dream? So yea, that's pretty out of the blue. \n\n&gt; Its an illustration of fear and wonder.

The presentation is logically coherent (if you're going into a virtual world, it's clearly demonstrated).  The boundaries between what the viewer is to take literally vs figuratively is very clear. You can have an awesome thesis, but obscuring the steps doesn't make the thesis any better, nor make a bad thesis good. The types of movies I'm objecting to mostly rely on obscuring to raise their value, as opposed to having something good to say in the first place.\n\n2) The philosophy was also optional; you could enjoy the film for the action and story even if you didn't care at all about the message behind it. \n\nBut those are things to not hate the movie for, rather than reasons to like it.\n\n\nTo break down the reasons for why I liked the matrix are a few, some mechanical, others philosophical:\n\nIt's obviously a very well executed film in terms of graphics, cinematography, and just an enjoyable experience.\n\nPhilosophically, the themes happen to agree with my viewpoints. I value truth and more accurate perspectives. I think there is a lot of sht and propaganda that we swallow and think is true and agree with for a variety of reasons rooted in conditioning and hacking the mind... that when examined with the reliable tool of logic, turn out to be contradictory.

If each scene took so unnecessarily long, I'd call it out just like I called out the A Space Odyssey. If it had been ambiguous about what the viewer should take as literal occurrence vs metaphor, I'd give it the same complaints. If it was strictly metaphorical, but the metaphor could have many different meanings, then I'd also call that stupid. You have a clear intention, so pin it down. Unless your point is to be ambiguous and open ended. If you really want to do that, then be clear about THAT, and say that that's what you're doing. and if you're going to do that, then for the love of boobs, have the courtesy and straightforwardness to clearly convey what we are to take metaphorically vs literally.\n\nIt's more of the specific practices in pretentious and academic film making that I find so annoying and utterly pointless.\n\nIt's like writing a mathematical proof by skipping steps.

The boundaries between what the viewer is to take literally vs figuratively is very clear. You can have an awesome thesis, but obscuring the steps doesn&amp;#39;t make the thesis any better, nor make a bad thesis good. The types of movies I&amp;#39;m objecting to mostly rely on obscuring to raise their value, as opposed to having something good to say in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) The philosophy was also optional; you could enjoy the film for the action and story even if you didn&amp;#39;t care at all about the message behind it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But those are things to not hate the movie for, rather than reasons to like it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To break down the reasons for why I liked the matrix are a few, some mechanical, others philosophical:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s obviously a very well executed film in terms of graphics, cinematography, and just an enjoyable experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Philosophically, the themes happen to agree with my viewpoints. I value truth and more accurate perspectives. I think there is a lot of sht and propaganda that we swallow and think is true and agree with for a variety of reasons rooted in conditioning and hacking the mind... that when examined with the reliable tool of logic, turn out to be contradictory. And I think having correct perspectives and ways of looking at things, and determining what is true is the tools for engineering good societies (whatever that means), and detecting exploitative parasites, especially the ones with so much power in charge of the state).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the Matrix had been presented in a very implicit way, like you could not tell clearly if they were in the matrix or outside of it, then I&amp;#39;d give it the same &amp;quot;too implicit&amp;quot; flag. If each scene took so unnecessarily long, I&amp;#39;d call it out just like I called out the A Space Odyssey. If it had been ambiguous about what the viewer should take as literal occurrence vs metaphor, I&amp;#39;d give it the same complaints. If it was strictly metaphorical, but the metaphor could have many different meanings, then I&amp;#39;d also call that stupid. You have a clear intention, so pin it down. Unless your point is to be ambiguous and open ended. If you really want to do that, then be clear about THAT, and say that that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re doing. and if you&amp;#39;re going to do that, then for the love of boobs, have the courtesy and straightforwardness to clearly convey what we are to take metaphorically vs literally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s more of the specific practices in pretentious and academic film making that I find so annoying and utterly pointless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like writing a mathematical proof by skipping steps. It&amp;#39;s like writing a paragraph with missing sentences. It&amp;#39;s like giving a presentation without key slides...... and then patting yourself on the back for it, and calling that &amp;quot;artistic&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;deep&amp;quot;. No, that&amp;#39;s just lazy and skipping steps... and if you pat yourself on the back for it, pretentious.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_d2oc5xs", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/4h8m6l/cmv_a_space_odyssey_and_other_such_films_are/d2oc5xs/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1462133647.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462104847.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2obx2n", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jeanfelixpiccard", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_4h8m6l", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Tell us which film you liked.
