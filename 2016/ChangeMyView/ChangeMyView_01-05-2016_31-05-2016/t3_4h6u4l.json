The only difference now, as you pointed out, is that these salespeople have retail space. So if you take that away, nothing changes except the location of the illegal and unregulated sales. So you do absolutely no good by closing down the shops.

It&amp;#39;s regulated. The store fronts are all currently illegal, and run by their own individual standards. There&amp;#39;s no way to know who their clientele is, or what their policies and operating practices actually are. Quite simply, zero regulation. Some of the concerns are addressed in the article linked above.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And my counterargument to this is that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; illegal drugs are sold with no quality control or regulation. The only difference now, as you pointed out, is that these salespeople have retail space. So if you take that away, nothing changes except the location of the illegal and unregulated sales.
