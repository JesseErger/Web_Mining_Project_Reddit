Without your sex drive, you may be more content to do a lot less (e.g. you&amp;#39;d be less likely to worry about your health, because you&amp;#39;d not be trying to attract a mate), meet a lot less people, and experience a lot less things (particularly if you&amp;#39;re more of an introvert or something of that sort). I don&amp;#39;t know if this point alone could entirely change your view, but hopefully it does help you see that it&amp;#39;s not entirely a downside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(This point also assumes that close, emotional-connection is important to you.
