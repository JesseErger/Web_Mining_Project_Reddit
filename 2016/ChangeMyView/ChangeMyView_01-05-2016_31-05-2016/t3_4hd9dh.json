I'll take on a couple of the claims you made: that social media creates narcissism and has no constructive purpose. \n\nRegarding narcissism, there is a modest correlation between the amount of posts people make to Facebook and Twitter and narcissism, but this isn't quite the same thing as saying that social media causes narcissism. First off, there is no evidence of a correlation between spending time using social media and narcissism. Only certain types of social media use (e.g., posting frequency) are associated with higher levels of narcissism. Secondly, the evidence is only correlational. It seems likely to me that people with pre-existing high levels of narcissism seek out Facebook and particularly Twitter (social media in which they can reach a larger audience, rather than social media that connects small groups of people to one another, like Snapchat) to try to obtain the attention they seek. According to this view, if we took social media away, there would still be narcissistic folks who would simply find another avenue in which to be narcissistic. There is evidence of a general upward trend in narcissism, but this trend preceded social media. Of course, this doesn't mean that social media isn't accelerating that trend, and I wouldn't be surprised if it is (to some modest degree), but I have yet to see evidence of cause rather than evidence of correlation. \n\nRegarding the lack of benefit, there is plenty of evidence suggesting a connection between social media use and social capital and social support during times of need. People who use social media find out about job opportunities through it (not just through LinkedIn, but through Facebook friends, Twitter, etc.). There are many folks who don't have strong social networks around them at work, where they live, or through their families. For these people, social media can provide much needed support when things get bad. Again, it's hard to see this when you don't fit into that category and all you see people doing on Facebook is posting lame memes, but it is happening.\n\nMaking generalizations about social media's impact will be like making generalizations about the impact of the Internet, or the impact of print. The applications of all of these media were small and uniform at first, and our initial impressions of the impact of all of these tended to linger even after the applications of all of them become increasingly diverse. It's most likely true that certain types of social media use will lead to certain outcomes. \n", "edited": 1462208995.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing about the social media experience is that it is extremely individualized and customized.
