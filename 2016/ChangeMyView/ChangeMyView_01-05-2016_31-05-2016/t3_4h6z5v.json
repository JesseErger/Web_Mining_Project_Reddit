Once she recovered, she finished high school and decided to go to a local university to get a degree in teaching. Here's the thing, this was before all of the ADA regulations, and the university had several two story buildings with no elevators on a university campus built on extreme hills. Grandma had one class on the second floor - no elevators, no ramps. She was fortunate that her mom decided to go to school with her, and her mom had an idea, put grandma and her wheelchair into the dumbwaiter, normally reserved for books, and haul her up that way. Grandma fit, if she hunched over, and that worked for a while. Unfortunately, the administration found out what was happening and told her the would kick her out if she did it again.

She was humiliated and miserable, but persevered.\n\nI now go to that same university and have classes in the same building that has now been revamped to fit ADA regs.
