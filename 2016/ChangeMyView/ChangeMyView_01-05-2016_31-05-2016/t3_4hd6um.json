They like to have sex with normal people using knives, guns and brand-new sexual organs that you did not know existed. So you vote for television, and everyone else, as far as the eye can see, votes to fuck you with switchblades. That's voting.\n\nMore to the point, that's an example of simple majority rule. Another way of stating this is \"30 wolves and 4 sheep voting on what to have for dinner.\" \n\nWith that in mind, one of the reasons we operate under a *representative* democracy instead of an *absolute* democracy is to prevent the nation from being run by a simple majority. To enable the simple majority could lead to the nation's legislation being driven entirely by those high population areas, which means you don't really have a union of independent states anymore. You'd have a collection of powerful city-states, instead. \n\nTo get around this, the operating document of the United States, the Constitution, calls for equal representation between the States in the Senate and proportional representation in the House. This was the [Connecticut Compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Compromise) and was done to prevent the interests of the larger and more-populated states from overriding the interests of the smaller and less-populated states while drafting legislation in Congress. This plan wasn't universally loved; as you might imagine the larger states disliked it, as it undercuts the power their representatives can wield. \n\nThe Electoral College as a voting system stems from this concern. The College was one of the many compromises reached during the [Constitutional Convention of 1787](http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Documents/The%20Electoral%20College%20(Jan.%202011\\).pdf) (pdf warning). The idea is the same; to avoid the risk of pure majority rule, we don't give the public the ability to directly choose the president by popular vote. \n\n---\n\nWith that out of the way, I'll now offer a complaint. \n\n&gt;In my opinion, there are other groups who deserve extra voting powers far more, because they are far less represented (african americans, trans* folk, etc.). But I don't think that anyone should get that sort of preferential treatment.\n\nYou couch this as an opinion, but it's inconsistent - you hold up other groups as \"more deserving\" of extra voting rights, then immediately about-face on the very concept. I don't think this is your *opinion*; I think it's your *spoiler*, a crude attempt at a logic trap to derail the arguments you've been presented. \n\nI see this point as an intentional oversimplification of /u/CunningAllusionment's statement. The 146 urban counties represent a simple majority (50%+1) while the 2,854 other counties represent the remainder (50%-1). \n\nYou then conflate the mathematic simple minority of enfranchised voters (that 50%-1 represents around 125 million people) with other kinds of minorities, such as the African American ethnic miniority (12.6% of the US population) and the minority gender identification of trans* folk (0.2% to 0.3%). \n\n*No*, the other forms of minorities should not get \"extra voting power\", as they're *already* represented as members of the existing voter base. Some of the 100% of eligible voters will be black. Some of them will be trans. Some of them will be otherkin attack helicopters. None of those other minority forms matter in this context - we're discussing the electorate in a first-past-the-post system. \n\nTrying to tie the apples to the many types of oranges here is disingenuous, though I believe you knew that when you drafted this \"opinion\".

It does that by basing the electoral vote count off of that states representation in Congress via the house and senate. the Senate gives every state 2 because we are all equal states.

Like I stated before, if the majority decides, then the cities would always be the deciding factor in who wins. The places with less people, states like Wyoming and other low population states, their voices would never matter because for every vote they cast, there are 3-4 people in the city who could easily vote against them and override them.

There would be total chaos. \n\nThird. The electoral college actually prevents a lot of election fraud. With the EC as the standard, if someone had access to the system and could add or subtract votes, they couldn't effect the election process as a whole.

So we give regions a little more power, so that their voice has more impact, because staright % does not show the distribution all that well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_d2proww", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/4hd6um/cmv_in_the_presidential_election_votes_should_not/d2proww/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1462234973.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462206173.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hd6um", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4hd6um", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2qn8ad", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iTARIS", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d2qmtvn", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt; Arguing with a position based on \"should\" is entirely subjective.\n\nYou're in /r/changemyview, everything is subjective.

This is not unlike the wealth gap that Bernie Sanders talks about. In the same way the rich supposedly use their wealth and power to get richer at the expense of everyone else, those 146 counties would use their power to make their lives better, at the expense of everyone else. It's a pretty unpleasant situation. \n\nI used to live in NY. in 2012, the gubernatorial election map looked like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/New_York_Governor_Election_Results_by_County,_2014.svg/2000px-New_York_Governor_Election_Results_by_County,_2014.svg.png). The Democrat won. More recently, just a few weeks ago, the primary map of NY looked like [this](http://imgur.com/eYILlx2). Hillary won (58% to 42%, I might add). The problem with this is that the places that tend to vote democratic (or for hillary, but that's not relevant to this discussion) are largely cities. In NY, whatever NYC wants the state to do, it does. And that's a HUGE problem. For instance, a $15 minimum wage in NYC makes sense. Heck, a $20 minimum wage in NYC probably makes sense. But not for a small town up north. The cost of living isn't so high, and the population just isn't there to support a spike in wages. Or for instance, NY's gun laws. I won't go into detail, but they make a lot of sense in a city like NY, where you have police officers everywhere. Not so much out in the rural areas where one state trooper substation covers everything within a 15 mile radius. Those are just the easiest examples to give.\n\nSo why do I say all this? Well, going back to that map of the US population, with so much of it centered around the coasts and major cities, politicians wouldn't campaign in the middle of the country. As bad as it sounds, they'd care even less than they do about that area. And that's a problem, especially economically. The population centers are heavily white collar economies, and the rural areas are heavily blue collar. Regulations, especially environmental ones, that have little or no impact on white collar economies could be absolutely devastating to blue collar ones. This isn't to say we shouldn't consider the environment with regulations, by any means, but people making those laws need to be aware of the consequences of them. \n\nThe US is far too diverse, in almost every aspect, for a straight popular vote to be fair. The electoral college is far from perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than 5% of the counties determining who's governing the other 95%.
