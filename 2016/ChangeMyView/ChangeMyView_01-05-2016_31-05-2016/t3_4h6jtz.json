Assuming a more or less even distribution of these competencies, that's 100 of them per year, per class, per student. That's a lot of extra hoops to jump through for teachers, and it forces them to \"teach to the test\" in the same way as common core. Why is that something we should aspire to?\n\n&gt; How many teachers look at those results, and structure the class to ensure that each kid has an individual system to address those deficiencies?\n\nLots of them do. That's kind of the point of state testing -- to *force* teachers to evaluate student progress in certain areas and help them figure out where they need to improve and how they can do that.\n\n&gt; If grades and curriculum and testing were all looking at the same things\n\nThey do, loosely speaking.\n\n&gt; Whenever a curve is set. Each score is graded as a percentage. Not a percentage of a specific skill usually. Not an organized percentage. Just a percentage.\n\nThat doesn't really make any sense. Are you confusing *percentage* with *percentile*? Can you give a better explanation of exactly how these scores are calculated?\n\n&gt; So they looked at everyone's percent grade in each class, to determine what the top 1% really was. So yes, percentages are used more than just ACTs. Percent ranks are given based on grades.\n\nJust because you're using the word \"percent\" doesn't mean you're consistently talking about the same thing. Saying you got a grade of 70% means you earned 70% of the available points. It doesn't mean that you're dumber than 30% of the class. Again, I think you're confusing \"percentage\" and \"percentile.\"\n\n&gt; It is soul destroying, because it is not CONSTRUCTIVE feedback\n\nRight. The teacher GIVES constructive feedback, which is tailored to each student. If anything, it's much *more* constructive this way, because we're not forcing kids into cookie-cutter shapes. We're assessing them as individuals, not as a set of boxes to be ticked. A good teacher will be able to assess each kid and figure out what feedback to give to help that student succeed. That's constructive feedback.\n\nThe grade is just an objective measure of how you're doing compared to established expectations. Humans like scores. We like to know where we stand. It's a lot harder to know where you stand when you're looking at a list of a thousand competencies than if you just get a grade and some custom-tailored feedback.\n\n&gt; That is much more objective than a percent score in a class, that takes into account participation, attendance, test scores, and assignments scores. \n\nBut participation, attendance, tests, and assignments are important things in college. How well someone did on those things in high school is a huge indicator of their potential for success in college.\n\n&gt; A list of competencies, if everyone used the same list, is 1 billion times more objective than a percent score.\n\nLook, the competencies aren't objective, either. What qualifies as fulfillment of a specific competency for one teacher might be totally different from the next teacher's standards.\n\nOn top of that, it wouldn't really make sense for everyone to use the same list. What about electives like art and music? What about AP classes? What about when students are given a choice between physics, biology, and chemistry, but they aren't required to take all three?

Percent ranks are given based on grades. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If they think that getting a bad grade is &amp;quot;soul destroying,&amp;quot; then they&amp;#39;re woefully unprepared to enter the real world and assume the responsibilities of an adult.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is soul destroying, because it is not CONSTRUCTIVE feedback, in that a percentage does not tell them specific actionable things to work on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, what objective measures are colleges going to use to rank students and decide who to accept?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The objective measures of what skills have been mastered. That is much more objective than a percent score in a class, that takes into account participation, attendance, test scores, and assignments scores. A list of competencies, if everyone used the same list, is 1 billion times more objective than a percent score. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_d2nwuw5", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/4h6jtz/cmv_we_should_not_rank_kids_vs_each_other_we/d2nwuw5/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1462091862.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462063062.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2nuvgq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "on_my_lunch_break", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_4h6jtz", "score": 19, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I'd like to you clarify: What exactly is the view, here?\n\nYou start off with this title:\n\n&gt; We should not rank kids vs. each other.

When I was in grade school (in the state of Oregon), one such test was for writing samples. We'd do these a couple times a year, and we'd be graded on things like mechanics, organization, sentence structure, and word choice.\n\nAlso, most teachers -- the decent ones, at least -- give feedback about mastery (or lack thereof) as part of the grading process.

You can still do percentages, but it shouldn't be percentages on producing paperwork, or busywork.\n\nCan you give a practical explanation of how this would be implemented? Who decides what the competencies are? How do you measure and quantify each one? That also seems like an extraordinary amount of the \"busy work\" you were complaining about... so how would it improve things?\n\n&gt; The ranking is bad, and telling a kid that 72% of their peers are doing better is stupid.\n\nWhen does this ever happen, other than on tests like the SAT which are *by their very nature* intended to rank people?\n\n&gt; Giving them a grade is soul destroying.\n\nI don't see how. It tells you very clearly, with one number, where you stand. If a kid's ego is so fragile that they can't handle an honest assessment of their performance, then perhaps they need to toughen up. If they think that getting a bad grade is \"soul destroying,\" then they're woefully unprepared to enter the real world and assume the responsibilities of an adult.\n\nAlso, if they're so fragile that a letter grade will affect them that way, a laundry list of every tiny thing they haven't mastered will be *way* worse for them. Hell, I *liked* getting letter grades in school to measure my progress, but a list of every little thing that I haven't mastered would probably have given me a panic attack.\n\n&gt; Sure colleges will need to have ways of determining if kids get into their school. However, a letter grade, or percentage is stupid, and a list of specific competencies would be much better for everyone.\n\nSo, what objective measures are colleges going to use to rank students and decide who to accept?

Just giving someone a D is stupid, without (on the same piece of paper) telling them what they needed to study, to be more ready next time. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_d2ox9vy", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/4h6jtz/cmv_we_should_not_rank_kids_vs_each_other_we/d2ox9vy/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1462170996.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1462142196.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2o2rnr", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Njdevils11", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_4h6jtz", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Hi there, teacher here.

It might help to add a TL;DR.   \n  \nBusy work is not the greatest thing in the world and it can certainly be used inappropriately; however, there are some very important benefits to repeated work. First and foremost the only way to get better at something is to do it and do it a lot. It's called practice. Practicing works best when done under the eyes of an instructor.

Most grading systems, k-12, are not competitive. Just because grades of one student can be compared to grades of another student doesn't make it competitive.

Student scores are compared ao teachers can have a more realistic view of how competent the student is. A teacher might say if a student scores a 75% they meet my expectation level of proficiency. If the average score of the test was 60, then that says either my expectation was off, or my assessment was unfair, or I didn't teach it well. If you score a 60, well good for you, if you score a 30 we might need to talk.   \n  \nWhile I agree that letter grades are not specific, when you reach the level of getting a letter grade specificity is not the issue. proficiency specificity is really only important for foundational skills like elementary reading, writing and math.   \n  \nOnce you have those skills, the learning is shifted on the the student.

Usually class participation is counted because the teacher needs to know what you are able to do on the fly. If you don't participate in class, they can't know that.

You already have a system that tracks competency on a small-scale. That this should somehow be tailored to work at the students own speed is not realistic in a classroom setting under the linearity of time, and thus, a student falling behind must seek after/before hours tutoring, which many teachers offer. \n\nI understand the concept that grade-ranking can cause an inferiority complex to arise in a student, place unnecessary pressure on a student, etc. This is not necessarily harmful in high-school because life is not getting any easier for those students, and they need preparation for the competitiveness of the real world in order to not be naive about reality.

By observing their work ethic and habits, players can emulate better players and thus improve themselves. This seems like a natural extension of human nature. He can do it, why can&amp;#39;t I? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is the teacher&amp;#39;s job to direct students in a healthy and intelligent fashion, to where a student will understand what is being taught and what is expected to be &amp;quot;mastered.&amp;quot; If you get an 88% on a vocabulary test, you have mastered 88% of those words. The idea that a percentage is ineffective in showing what is mastered does not resonate with me because of examples like this. Especially now, with scan-trons in standardized testing, teachers can graph and visualize what problems students are missing, how many students missed it, and who missed it, faster than ever. If you want a way to see, at a micro-level, what you haven&amp;#39;t mastered yet, just look back at every piece of homework, every quiz, and every test at the problems you missed. That is all one needs. You already have a system that tracks competency on a small-scale. That this should somehow be tailored to work at the students own speed is not realistic in a classroom setting under the linearity of time, and thus, a student falling behind must seek after/before hours tutoring, which many teachers offer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand the concept that grade-ranking can cause an inferiority complex to arise in a student, place unnecessary pressure on a student, etc. This is not necessarily harmful in high-school because life is not getting any easier for those students, and they need preparation for the competitiveness of the real world in order to not be naive about reality. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_d2og9df", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/4h6jtz/cmv_we_should_not_rank_kids_vs_each_other_we/d2og9df/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1462143422.0, "author_flair_text": "1\u2206", "created_utc": 1462114622.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4h6jtz", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4h6jtz", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4h6jtz", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2p06de", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "non-rhetorical", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d2oxn2w", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Haha.
