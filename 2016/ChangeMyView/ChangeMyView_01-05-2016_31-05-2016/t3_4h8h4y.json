He&amp;#39;s lost jobs over it, missed raises over it, after 9/11 people avoided him because he had brown skin. My father has been the direct victim of racism, even though he ID&amp;#39;s as white.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yes, that affected my upbringing a lot. I feel I have slightly more of a voice in the conversation about race and racism, specifically in reference to my own heritage, than other white people. My connection to my ancestors is pretty darn loose, but I still think it&amp;#39;s a matter of personal responsibility that I step up to the plate and say &amp;quot;okay other white people, here&amp;#39;s why this is shitty.&amp;quot; I identify with that oppressed group of people as their descendant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I do it as a white person who acknowledges that on the street, people aren&amp;#39;t racist to me. I do it as a white person who knows that I still have racist stuff that I need to unlearn because it&amp;#39;s not productive and because it&amp;#39;s disrespectful to other people. Sometimes I mention the fact that I identify with that oppression and people roll their eyes. Sometimes they don&amp;#39;t. But it has never once taken away my voice because as a white person, other white people tend to respect my opinion on the matter more than the opinions of marginalized people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A white kid with non-white family will always have the benefit of being perceived as white, despite their upbringing. Is it racist to assume that someone descended from a marginalized people can&amp;#39;t have white skin? Yes, absolutely. Is it racist to assume that their current marginalization is not on the basis of their skin tone? Not really. You yourself addressed the fact that the effects you&amp;#39;re concerned about are indirect.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_d2ogu8b", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/4h8h4y/cmv_isnt_reverse_racism_in_itself_racism/d2ogu8b/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1462144505.0, "author_flair_text": "3\u2206", "created_utc": 1462115705.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4h8h4y", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4h8h4y", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_4h8h4y", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d2rqa8j", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RustyRook", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d2rogen", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Sorry madmace2000, your comment has been removed: \n\n&gt; Comment Rule 5\\. \"No low effort comments.
