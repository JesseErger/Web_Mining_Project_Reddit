People who work for a company who have advance notice of a decision the company will make that will affect share price often do adjust their portfolio in anticipation of this with no real consequences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The big, insidious kinds of insider trading that we actively police are 1) When someone with the inside knowledge shares it outside the company, because then you have an employee working against the interests of the company (it wouldn&amp;#39;t be secret if the company didn&amp;#39;t want it secret). 2) People with the ability to influence share price using this to enrich themselves at the expense of the company. This is almost exclusively high-level management, CEO&amp;#39;s and board members. We don&amp;#39;t want them making decisions that hurt the company but benefit their short position, or planning a merger just for the short-term jump in share price, or otherwise misleading other investors to their own benefit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cyjmfjy", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/3z5hul/cmv_insider_trading_on_stocks_should_not_be/cyjmfjy/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1451796387.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1451767587.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3z5hul", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cyjqpml", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DeltaBot", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cyjdx5v", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/Thamanizer. ^[[History](/r/changemyview/wiki/user/Thamanizer)]\n\n^[[Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltabot)][[Code](https://github.com/alexames/DeltaBot)][/r/DeltaBot]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "points", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to &lt;a href=\"/u/Thamanizer\"&gt;/u/Thamanizer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href=\"/r/changemyview/wiki/user/Thamanizer\"&gt;History&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltabot\"&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt;][&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/alexames/DeltaBot\"&gt;Code&lt;/a&gt;][&lt;a href=\"/r/DeltaBot\"&gt;/r/DeltaBot&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cyjqpml", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/3z5hul/cmv_insider_trading_on_stocks_should_not_be/cyjqpml/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1451804171.0, "author_flair_text": "\u221e\u2206", "created_utc": 1451775371.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": "moderator"}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cyjdx5v", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kingofthefeminists", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cyjdjs5", "score": 35, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "\u2206 \n\nSimilar to the other delta I gave out (saw both your and the other comment at about the same time and they made a very similar point).
