It's not universal of course, but often times in less developed countries people simply have a different relationship with death. In the US, when someone dies, it's almost rare to see them before the body is rushed off to a secluded place and made to look as \"alive\" as possible before it is again removed from view.\n\nIn many other much less developed countries you may find families preparing the bodies of loved ones for burial. Children are exposed to death from a young age, so it isn't quite as foreign to them. They adjust while young and it isn't so shocking when they reach adulthood. We, on the other hand, are often more insulated from death than most historical societies. We are often only reminded of death in the occasional abstract way, and when we do finally confront its reality, it can be a harsh and eye opening experience. Our unchallenged sense of our own permanence is called into question and this is often uncomfortable for most of us.\n\nI'm also not sure that further insulation from death is a good answer to \"feeling\" better about it. In more developed countries we're not necessarily depressed because we're too exposed (although of course, in war torn regions great exposure to death can obviously be devastating, but even some of the stories of childhood soldiers having been rehabilitated is quite amazing). It is possible to make some degree of peace with the nature of our own temporary experience. People do it all the time. \n\nAnd what does insulating ourselves form death really protect us from? Eventually, if we're \"lucky\" enough to live a long life, being exposed isn't even an avoidable experience anyway. Sooner or later it will show up and if we weren't fortunate enough to learn good coping skills to deal with it in the past, it will likely be more difficult than ever to confront.\n\nI think hiding from death is worse, in some ways, than acknowledging and accepting the nature of our own existence. Death informs a well lived life. If we ignore the passage of time, our ever changing circumstances, and don't do our best to live fully because we recognize that we really don't have forever, then when those moments do arrive where we're finally confronted with the unavoidable nature of our own death, we're left with regrets. Because we didn't do the things that would have been important to a person who knew they didn't have forever to do it all.\n\nI'd rather see the coming loss and live well in advance of it, than to pretend it wasn't coming and be full of regrets when it finally arrives.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": " points", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, I hold almost the polar opposite perspective.

We, on the other hand, are often more insulated from death than most historical societies. We are often only reminded of death in the occasional abstract way, and when we do finally confront its reality, it can be a harsh and eye opening experience. Our unchallenged sense of our own permanence is called into question and this is often uncomfortable for most of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also not sure that further insulation from death is a good answer to &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot; better about it. In more developed countries we&amp;#39;re not necessarily depressed because we&amp;#39;re too exposed (although of course, in war torn regions great exposure to death can obviously be devastating, but even some of the stories of childhood soldiers having been rehabilitated is quite amazing). It is possible to make some degree of peace with the nature of our own temporary experience. People do it all the time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what does insulating ourselves form death really protect us from? Eventually, if we&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;lucky&amp;quot; enough to live a long life, being exposed isn&amp;#39;t even an avoidable experience anyway. Sooner or later it will show up and if we weren&amp;#39;t fortunate enough to learn good coping skills to deal with it in the past, it will likely be more difficult than ever to confront.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think hiding from death is worse, in some ways, than acknowledging and accepting the nature of our own existence. Death informs a well lived life. If we ignore the passage of time, our ever changing circumstances, and don&amp;#39;t do our best to live fully because we recognize that we really don&amp;#39;t have forever, then when those moments do arrive where we&amp;#39;re finally confronted with the unavoidable nature of our own death, we&amp;#39;re left with regrets. Because we didn&amp;#39;t do the things that would have been important to a person who knew they didn&amp;#39;t have forever to do it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d rather see the coming loss and live well in advance of it, than to pretend it wasn&amp;#39;t coming and be full of regrets when it finally arrives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cyio3dl", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/3z1ruc/cmv_ubiquitous_reminders_of_our_mortality_and_the/cyio3dl/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1451715611.0, "author_flair_text": "16\u2206", "created_utc": 1451686811.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3z1ruc", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3z1ruc", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3z1ruc", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3z1ruc", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3z1ruc", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cyjisgy", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ExploreMeDora", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cyji7p6", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "You're looking at it very narrowly.
