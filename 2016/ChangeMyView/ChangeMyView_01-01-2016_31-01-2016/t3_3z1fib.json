(The actual stats are that 1 in 53 will experience either rape, attempted rape, or threat of rape. The 1 in 5 is something quite different.) This fringe advocacy even led to the Office of Civil Rights to send out their infamous [2011 Title IX \"Dear Colleague\" letter](https://www.thefire.org/why-the-office-for-civil-rights-april-dear-colleague-letter-was-2011s-biggest-fire-fight/) that has resulting in many innocent people being seriously harmed by very bad policies at universities and colleges. This same moral panic is what drove Sabrina Erdely of Rolling Stone magazine to seek out examples of how there was a rape epidemic on campuses and the schools were doing nothing, and the only case she could find to back up the portrayal was the UVA story of Jackie that was a complete fabrication; but they pushed it through and [harmed many people](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/uva-fraternity-sues-rolling-stone-magazine-25-million-n460316).\n\nThe fact they are fringe doesn't mean they aren't harmful.

So a fringe position might be statistically unrepresentative, but if the consequences of the fringe actions are severe, the outcome is significantly greater than the rational positions (which are statistically more common but much less severe in consequence).\n\nHence it is the magnitude of *outcome* here that matters, not how fringe it is. This is why the rational representatives of a movement get drowned out. School policies are getting changed because of the violent and vocal fringe, as absurd as their positions are. \n\nI agree there is a problem with an attempted smear. Critics of GamerGate and MRAs smear them by portraying them based on their fringe, but the same is true of feminism, SJWs, and BLM.\n\nIslam may be a different story as I think it has largely gotten past that point. The people claiming all Muslims are terrorist are an extreme fringe themselves; the bigger confrontation is between those who criticize the *ideas* of Islam, of Islamists, and of Jihadists, and are accused of being Islamophobes.
