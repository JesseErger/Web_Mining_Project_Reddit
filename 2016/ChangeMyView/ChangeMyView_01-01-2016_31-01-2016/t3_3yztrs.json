Why stop at equality? Why should the federal government provide the right to do anything? Fill in the blanks with the same rhetoric of dark side authoritarian for your right to bear arms, your right to fair trial, your right for due process, your right for freedom of speech. \n\nDon't forget these federal rules and laws aren't just made up by the president at the time and put into action (that would be authoritarian). These federal rules and laws, goes through checks and balances by Congress and Senate in which representatives from each state has a say and finally vote to put these laws and rules into effect. That is democracy and is what makes America great. \n\nUltimately, these federal rules and laws, are made because they believe this is what every American should be entitled to. You know how it only takes a few bad eggs to think the whole is corrupt and spoiled? The federal laws and rules is there to stop the rest of the world from perceiving us based on our bad eggs, because if a state was to make a rule that prevents people of certain color, creed, religion etc to go out and vote, eat, marry, etc. Then the rest of the world would only see that black eye as a representative of America as a whole, even though you may just view it as that is representative of the state.\n\n\n&gt; No one was preventing anyone from think of someone as equal, people just choose to not consider others equal. No one was stopping anyone from think of other people as equal, either individuals think someone else it equal to them or they don't. I think everyone should be equal under federal law but if the states decide something different (that doesn't result in cruel and unusual punishment), then that should be fine.\n\nYou are either contradicting your self here or just misinformed on America's history. There was people stopping others from thinking everybody is equal. In fact at the state level, they had such laws called the Jim Crow Laws. So all the states that had jim crow laws was preventing everybody in that state to think of someone as an equal (black eye on the nation). Civil rights and civil liberties is important enough that enough representatives from every state had signed off on it because that is the final answer that should represent America. \n\nCertainly, everybody is free to choose what they think. But when you have Jim crow laws that re-enforces the thought that we are not equal, people born in those states will think that is the norm. That people of other color, creeds, however you want to divide them up by, are second class citizens. That is the true dark side, government forcing people to think a certain way. \n\n\n\nI know you'll probably pick a couple of lines and reply focusing on that, and that's fine. However, to continue this conversation, the next time you reply to me, Answer these few questions so I know what you are thinking. \n\nIf you want to shift the power from the federal level to the state level, why stop there? Why not shift it even lower to the cities and towns since it is much easier to move from one town in your same state to another, that has laws that fit your believes. If you agree with that notion, then America would be filled with potential land mines. Land mines that I don't know I'm stepping into when I travel through other states and suddenly I am denied service for food and boarding because of my creed and race. And when I take my horror stories back to my states or even tell it to the world, you, may see it as a black eye on that state (or city depending if you agree to shift the power even more), but everybody else would see it as a black eye on the nation as a whole. \n\n\nPrime example. Police brutality. Every single time you hear of stories of police brutality, some people may think that is an example of the bad eggs that represents that town, that police force. Yet every time those news stories hit the public, it becomes a black eye on the police force as a whole, no matter which state or city you are from. \n\n\nThere was a time when I thought the federal government should fuck off and let me live based on where-ever I find it most pleasing due to state and local laws. However, the only reason why my final conclusion is to ultimately have the federal government, and step away from giving more power to a bunch of separated states and towns, is because the things at the federal government level should be awarded to all American citizens. Don't forget, the federal laws and rules are brought forth and voted on democratically by all the states. So, we as a country in this era is pushing things like civil rights and civil liberties with the backing of the majority of the states. Just like prohibition was a mistake and eventually repealed. If you feel certain laws and rules the federal government is a mistake, take your part in the democratic process and change them that way. \n\n\nThe more power we shift to the states and local government, the more we stop acting as a country whose states are united. If you want to go down that route of \n\n&gt; This should go right down to the cities and neighborhoods! Chicago wants a family dynasty in power instead of a mayor? Fine. Los Angeles wants workers to decide things instead of a mayor? Fine. New York City wants to be governed by an aristocracy? Fine. Oak Street says no porn on their street - fine; don't like it go to another neighborhood. Main Street says they want a debauch paradise - fine; don't like that don't live on or take your kids to Main Street. 1st Street doesn't like pitbulls - fine; don't live there with your pitbull. That kinda thing provides more power to the people anyway because they have way more power over their state and municipal governments, than the federal, in which their opinion is nothing if it doesn't fall in line with that of the ruling party.\n\n\nThen, what is the point of America as a country? Just like Europe is broken up by each individual country, but is united by things like their currency. The total area of Europe is about the same as the total area of America. Of course, just like each country in Europe has their own culture in what they believe to be the correct way of living, so to does all the states in America. The only difference is Europe is actually divided by each country while America stands as United States (U.S). What you are advocating is to ultimately end America as a country and to split up each state as their own country. \n\n\nIf that is what you think, then there is nothing I can say to change your view. I don't believe America should be more localist and give its ultimate power to the state and local levels because it undermines what America is as a whole.

As such, whatever one state does does not just affect themselves, but can also seriously affect neighboring states too. Let&amp;#39;s say that Connecticut enacts the harshest gun laws possible. If Massachusetts does not, then the laws become entirely pointless because guns can easily flow from Massachusetts to Connecticut. This is the point of a federal government, to prevent any single state enacting a measure that would serve to harm another state.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cyinqq4", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/3yztrs/cmv_america_should_be_more_localist_and/cyinqq4/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1451714954.0, "author_flair_text": "45\u2206", "created_utc": 1451686154.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3yztrs", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3yztrs", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3yztrs", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3yztrs", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cyn0o4c", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MultiAli2", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cyj7co6", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Yes!\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cyn0o4c", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/3yztrs/cmv_america_should_be_more_localist_and/cyn0o4c/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1452046978.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1452018178.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cyj7co6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "terryfrombronx", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cyisve5", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Ok, so you do agree that the Federal Government should have some power, it's just a matter of where its turf ends and the individual States' turf begins.
