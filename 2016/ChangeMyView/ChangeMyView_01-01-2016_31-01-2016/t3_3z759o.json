I hope we can avoid the obvious political reasons that make it difficult to implement this system. \n\nFirst, let use remember that Canada, UK, Australia - the Anglo-sphere have more in common with the US than other countries. This is important. Let us also remember that Canada, was a late adopter of universal health care - and it started with a single province and then was modified for the whole country.\n\nSecond, let us also remember, that Taiwan has a single payer healthcare system. It was actually model (and against lol) the US system - it is based on the US Medicare system except expanded for coverage of all citizens. I think it includes dental. \n\nI just want to give a quick \"global\" background for a preliminary understanding that other countries had barriers and managed to create systems through a one payer system. \n\n----------\n\n1) Your population isn't too big. For a one payer system, there would still be ways to manage heathcare delivery. Canada is a huge country - as you know - and it manages to provide efficient healthcare delivery by using several mechanisms.\na) Canada as a country doesn't do shit except ensure drugs are safe, First Nations has access, army has access to health, etc. They give money (Social-Health transfers) to the provinces and they provide health. If anything, by removing delivery by provinces - you can probably make Canada even better - but that requires a PhD dissertation on Federalism and quality healthcare. \n\nEasily, the US can implement a model similar to this - by creating organizations through medicare that directly deal with healthcare delivery services in regions. Speaking of regions, in order to mobilize inefficiencies in the system, you can create Regional Health Authorities to help \"micro-manage\" and integrate services. They would probably be intra-state. \n\nAlso - remember that healthcare delivery is still private often!\n\n2) Language, etc, is not really an issue. It just means that the government can ensure that private agencies have language/multicultural services before getting contracts. There are many ways to roll it out. \n\nAlso, the US is not really that complex genetically. I mean, England is Caribbean, African, Indian, East Asian, etc. Canada actually has two official languages, and First Nations are a priority for healthcare delivery. I don't mean to minimize your concern, but I feel it is a non-issue and one that is work-able!\n\n3) Although many people hate medicare - it actually is efficient. It may be much more efficient than the private sector. For one, it is most likely the leading source of quality improvement. In order to receive medicare, you have to roll out inter-operable health informatic systems, you have to ensure you practice evidence based medicine. Remember, healthcare is a system - that is homecare, LTC, hospital, physio, nurses, physicians, etc - the government is just inherently in a better position to coordinate them. \n\nThis is why the US is over-paying for medical care - healthcare is just different than the post office or trains. It requires regulation and government oversight.

I hope we can avoid the obvious political reasons that make it difficult to implement this system. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, let use remember that Canada, UK, Australia - the Anglo-sphere have more in common with the US than other countries. This is important. Let us also remember that Canada, was a late adopter of universal health care - and it started with a single province and then was modified for the whole country.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, let us also remember, that Taiwan has a single payer healthcare system. It was actually model (and against lol) the US system - it is based on the US Medicare system except expanded for coverage of all citizens. I think it includes dental. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just want to give a quick &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; background for a preliminary understanding that other countries had barriers and managed to create systems through a one payer system. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Your population isn&amp;#39;t too big. For a one payer system, there would still be ways to manage heathcare delivery. Canada is a huge country - as you know - and it manages to provide efficient healthcare delivery by using several mechanisms.\na) Canada as a country doesn&amp;#39;t do shit except ensure drugs are safe, First Nations has access, army has access to health, etc. They give money (Social-Health transfers) to the provinces and they provide health. If anything, by removing delivery by provinces - you can probably make Canada even better - but that requires a PhD dissertation on Federalism and quality healthcare. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Easily, the US can implement a model similar to this - by creating organizations through medicare that directly deal with healthcare delivery services in regions. Speaking of regions, in order to mobilize inefficiencies in the system, you can create Regional Health Authorities to help &amp;quot;micro-manage&amp;quot; and integrate services. They would probably be intra-state. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also - remember that healthcare delivery is still private often!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Language, etc, is not really an issue. It just means that the government can ensure that private agencies have language/multicultural services before getting contracts. There are many ways to roll it out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, the US is not really that complex genetically. I mean, England is Caribbean, African, Indian, East Asian, etc. Canada actually has two official languages, and First Nations are a priority for healthcare delivery. I don&amp;#39;t mean to minimize your concern, but I feel it is a non-issue and one that is work-able!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Although many people hate medicare - it actually is efficient. It may be much more efficient than the private sector. For one, it is most likely the leading source of quality improvement. In order to receive medicare, you have to roll out inter-operable health informatic systems, you have to ensure you practice evidence based medicine. Remember, healthcare is a system - that is homecare, LTC, hospital, physio, nurses, physicians, etc - the government is just inherently in a better position to coordinate them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why the US is over-paying for medical care - healthcare is just different than the post office or trains. It requires regulation and government oversight. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cyjrg4v", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/3z759o/cmv_the_us_couldnt_successfully_implement_a/cyjrg4v/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1451805496.0, "author_flair_text": "19\u2206", "created_utc": 1451776696.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 19, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3z759o", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3z759o", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 8, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3z759o", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3z759o", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3z759o", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cykb68x", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Mange-Tout", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cyjypd8", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "But our current for-profit system already has lower standards in different places.
