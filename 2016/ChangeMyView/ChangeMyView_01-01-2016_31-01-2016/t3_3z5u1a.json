But copyright is an artificial construct that exists because society deems it so, and so goes for ownership itself. For instance nothing says that we couldn&amp;#39;t live in a communist society where nobody owns anything, or a society where knowledge is deemed to be of divine origin, so no man can lay an exclusive claim to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why shouldn&amp;#39;t it? Why are we entitled to that?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because that&amp;#39;s what copyright is for, &amp;quot;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re trying to promote progress by temporarily protecting creations so that authors and inventors can recoup their investment and are motivated to to the work. Therefore the right length for copyright is whichever length is best at promoting the progress of science and useful arts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there it follows we should try to extract the maximum possible from each capable person -- give them enough time to make creation profitable, but make it short enough that they have a reason to do it more than once, and that future generations need to do their own contribution to the progress of science and useful arts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_cykd5kh", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/3z5u1a/cmv_public_domain_day_is_a_misleading_celebration/cykd5kh/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1451860653.0, "author_flair_text": "29\u2206", "created_utc": 1451831853.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_3z5u1a", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 2, "name": "t1_cykdzeo", "id": "cykdzeo", "parent_id": "t1_cykb8vv", "depth": 7, "children": ["cykdzeo"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cykb8vv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Genoscythe_", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cykaptk", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt; Works aren't someone's creation?\n\nOf course they are.
