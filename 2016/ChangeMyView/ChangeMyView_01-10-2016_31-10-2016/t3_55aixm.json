Is &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;for better or for worse...has done the most to influence the events of the year&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, many war leaders and dictators have been on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the West, in general, won the war against the nazis but the west had committed similar atrocities,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source please on the UK or US committing genocide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But western regimes have enthusiastically supported regimes just as evil and murderous in the past 60 years which shows that the official line is untrue. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t make the best the enemy of the good, just because some western regimes have support some bad regimes doesn&amp;#39;t mean that all other regimes are equal. Take things individually. Expecting every western regime from 1945 to now never to even talk to a dictator seems asking too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Large scale modern wars come at such a cost to the citizenry that when the war is over, the citizens have the moral highground, one way to assuage them is to persuade them of how much better they are than the enemy and how it was immensely moral to vanquish the enemy, standard propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is no different that wars 2000 years ago, or 1000 years ago or 500 years ago. The winner always thinks they&amp;#39;re right. However that doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re always wrong either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stopping Nazism was the most important thing to do between 1939 and 1945. Yes Stalin did bad things, yes the Allies did bad things, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean those things cancel each other out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Nazi&amp;#39;s were perceived so badly, because they were so bad. That&amp;#39;s not to say that other people never kill anyone, or that other people maybe haven&amp;#39;t killed more. The detail is important, the regime showed the industrialisation of murder and torture. Stalin or Mao may have been happy to watch millions die to meet their ends. For nazism the end itself was the deaths, If they could ahve killed more they would have.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_d89hkg9", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/55aixm/cmvthe_nazis_are_perceived_so_badly_as_an/d89hkg9/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1475353479.0, "author_flair_text": "15\u2206", "created_utc": 1475324679.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 4, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_55aixm", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_55aixm", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_55aixm", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d89lgpe", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EliteKill", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d89ktk2", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "No, because the Nazis weren't simply enemies of the US, they were enemies of the rest of the developed world.

But not it wasn't some grand overreaction. In fact many of things that US made up about Germany were innocently harmless compared to what was actually happening. Remember that concentration camps and such weren't known until the end of WW2. Or near the end. There were rumors sure, the SS myths, mass killings, and extermination of certain villages. Few hundreds civilians here, or there. But not really concrete facts. But as the war went, and near the end of it where Germany army en mass surrendered allies started to get really accurate info of Nazi atrocities.\n\nOkay, first you can read about US attrocities. It's not some grand [secret](As the West, in general, won the war against the nazis but the west had committed similar atrocities, a narrative had to be created that made the nazis seem uniquely and perversely bad (which they were in fact in many ways) and so the demonisation of Nazi germany served its purpose.). And many other sources with more or less questionable facts. But the general gist is the same. \n\nThe worst allies (excluding the USSR which was way worse than Nazi's in almost every respect). The worst they did was killing some 100 german prisonners. Which, don't get me wrong. Is unthinkably abominable by today's standard. If you heard in news that US soldiers executed some 100 ISIS prisonners it would be warcrime that would go down in history. But back then, it really wasn't anything that strange of an occasion. Geneva convention was relatively new thing. A lot of officers were veterans of WW1. Where prisoners were routinely executed to spare resources. Looting of villages was a norm for poorly fed soldiers. And rape was overlooked because of in how poor conditions the soldiers lived for years at time (trench warfare, etc..). And the old customs were brought with them.\n\nBut the Nazi army established a whole new level of industrialized brutality on the scale only old Egyptians and Chinese  and Mongol emperors could match in their cruelty. Indeed many of German generals and officers refused to partake in those atrocities. That's the difference if you are looking for one.\n\nGerman officers refused to commit the attrocities they were ordered to. While US did it against orders, or when the upper branch looked the other way. That's really why the SS was established, to do the deeds a normal German soldiers refused to do. Again, you are thinking like this is some great US propaganda and cover up.\n\n\nBut really. We have testimony of the Germany's own generals what they did. And not under duress, in fact many of German generals were \"glad\" for their capture and shared their informations willingly. Not only that but we have direct testimonies of the survivors of those attrocities, their families, normal German soldiers, police, every branch of civilians in both Germany and German occupying countries, etc...\n\nThe undeneable truth is rathe clear. If you want to count bodies, Germans were trumped only by USSR, and maaaaaaybe the Japanese.\n\n&gt;But western regimes have enthusiastically supported regimes just as evil and murderous in the past 60 years which shows that the official line is untrue.\n\nAgain there is difference between west supporting Evil forces. And forces that turned out to be evil. \n\n&gt;Large scale modern wars come at such a cost to the citizenry that when the war is over, the citizens have the moral highground, one way to assuage them is to persuade them of how much better they are than the enemy and how it was immensely moral to vanquish the enemy, standard propaganda.\n\nAgain, that wasn't really necessary. The Germans weren't supportive of Nazistic regime and Hitler as everybody thinks. The analogy would be that Us elects Trump, who then starts WW3. Everybody hate's him, everybody grumbles, people try to depose him, maybe assasinations are underway, but ultimately he stays in power. And when it's over, people are glad the maniac is done.\n\nSame with Hitler. The civilians didn't resist. They didn't have to be treated as enemy. In returns Allies (excluding USSR yet again) the allies didn't have to show strength and occupy it. There wasn't any sense of national loss like with other occupying forces. None of these happened. There was zero civilian resistance, when Hitler was killed the German military fully supported allied forces in securing the country. And in return \"again\" German military took over the country's security under the micro-management of US. Who does that if you occupy the enemy?\n\nNot even month after one of the most brutal wars in history you see German soldiers patrolling the checkpoints together with US troops. The people who fought against allies a month earlier now worked with them. This isn't how blood enemies behave. \n\nLastly, not really sure on what point you want your mind changed.

And forces that turned out to be evil. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Large scale modern wars come at such a cost to the citizenry that when the war is over, the citizens have the moral highground, one way to assuage them is to persuade them of how much better they are than the enemy and how it was immensely moral to vanquish the enemy, standard propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, that wasn&amp;#39;t really necessary. The Germans weren&amp;#39;t supportive of Nazistic regime and Hitler as everybody thinks. The analogy would be that Us elects Trump, who then starts WW3. Everybody hate&amp;#39;s him, everybody grumbles, people try to depose him, maybe assasinations are underway, but ultimately he stays in power. And when it&amp;#39;s over, people are glad the maniac is done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same with Hitler. The civilians didn&amp;#39;t resist. They didn&amp;#39;t have to be treated as enemy. In returns Allies (excluding USSR yet again) the allies didn&amp;#39;t have to show strength and occupy it. There wasn&amp;#39;t any sense of national loss like with other occupying forces. None of these happened. There was zero civilian resistance, when Hitler was killed the German military fully supported allied forces in securing the country. And in return &amp;quot;again&amp;quot; German military took over the country&amp;#39;s security under the micro-management of US. Who does that if you occupy the enemy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not even month after one of the most brutal wars in history you see German soldiers patrolling the checkpoints together with US troops. The people who fought against allies a month earlier now worked with them. This isn&amp;#39;t how blood enemies behave. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, not really sure on what point you want your mind changed. You seem to have pointing that Nazi&amp;#39;s weren&amp;#39;t as bad as the allies. Which is the point I adressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_d89low4", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/55aixm/cmvthe_nazis_are_perceived_so_badly_as_an/d89low4/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1475362660.0, "author_flair_text": "62\u2206", "created_utc": 1475333860.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}]
