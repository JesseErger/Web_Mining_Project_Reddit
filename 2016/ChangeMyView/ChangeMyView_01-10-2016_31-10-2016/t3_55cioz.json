Now he is acting like a sore loser, tomorrow another batch of released emails that he can hold against Clinton. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to summarize, his strategy is: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;insult Clinton to lower her turnout;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;capitalise on his base that is non-traditional (from left wing to right wing, basically an anti-politician base; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;make an appeal, but not too soon, to get those last independents with something heart breaking (crying when his dog dies or something). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;try to stay alive in the debates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_d89lp0z", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/55cioz/cmvdonald_trumps_media_strategy_to_insult_women/d89lp0z/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1475362667.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1475333867.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d89l54q", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "heelspider", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d89klcn", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "You seem to have breezed right past my point.
