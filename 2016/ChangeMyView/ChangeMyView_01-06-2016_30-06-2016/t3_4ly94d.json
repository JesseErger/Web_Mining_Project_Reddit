We often need to have several rounds of OP responses to begin to understand whether they are at all open, or just pontificating.  Even then, we try to get other mods to weigh in, since it is a judgement call.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It also takes far more time to moderate than all of our other rules, since it requires going into the thread and really following the argument - is the OP moving the goalposts and resisting good arguments, or have they just not seen an argument that resonates with them, but they are really looking for it.  Since mods have lives too, these can languish for a long time waiting for us to get to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since this topic seems to have a higher likelihood of soapboxing, it&amp;#39;s definitely worth looking at slowing down a little.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your support.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_d3rnynn", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/4ly94d/were_considering_instituting_a_monthlong/d3rnynn/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1464815422.0, "author_flair_text": "228\u2206", "created_utc": 1464786622.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": "moderator"}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d3rku9w", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Tisarwat", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_4ly94d", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I'm not certain about what I think about a moratorium as I do try and change opinions on those posts, but I would like to thank the mods for considering solutions to a lot of posts that often contain seemingly bad faith attempts.
