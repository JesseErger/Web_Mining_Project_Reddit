I agree, it's not really a useful description. It doesn't ever really come up in real life, mostly just when explaining this sort of thing to people who ask. Pansexual because gender isn't a factor in whether or not I can be attracted to someone, and grey asexual because I can only experience sexual attraction to someone I've already been in some sort of sexual situation with. For most of my life, I didn't have any concept of an asexuality spectrum, and just assumed I was allosexual with a low libido. Upon further experience, though, I learned that I deal with sexuality very differently from most people. I had always assumed that what I now know is simply aesthetic appreciation was sexual attraction. I simply don't experience sexual attraction to people in passing. I've never checked anyone out, and didn't consciously realize that meant anything more than aesthetic appreciation until an allosexual friend explained it. I don't objectify people, or understand how body parts can be sexually attractive. As far as almost everyone is concerned, I'm asexual.

And once that has happened, I might be able to be sexually attracted to them, though still without objectification.\n\nThe main problem with using the Kinsey scale for comparison is that it isn't meant to measure sexual attraction or orientation, but practiced sexuality, the ratio of same- to other-gendered people that you actually fuck rather than want to.

Choosing the term probably has more to do with identity than technicalities though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think most people understand that they are different things (hence being able to mix and match labels without contradicting yourself) but both categories get lumped together because there&amp;#39;s nowhere else to put them? As someone else said, there&amp;#39;s no real authority defining these terms, and it&amp;#39;s hard to remember which boxes are which. Very confusing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The general consensus, at least in my circles, is that you might have some label like &amp;quot;lithoromantic demi-pansexual&amp;quot; yet call youself &amp;quot;bi&amp;quot; in public because it&amp;#39;s under the same umbrella. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_d3s7bi5", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/4lyxlc/cmv_most_nontraditional_sexualities_are_more_like/d3s7bi5/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1464841746.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1464812946.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d3ragpb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MotownMurder", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d3r9sgb", "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt;Sexual orientation is supposed to be about who you love/fuck not how.

There's no reason you can't be both heterosexual and need an emotional connection. \n\nWhere it differs from personality is that you may prefer to have a committed marriage ceremony before you have sex, or you may prefer to sleep with only people of your own narrowly defined political views, those things don't necessarily mean you feel no sexual attraction. The movie villain is totally sexy, and your fiance gets you horny, but you choose not to act on that. That's personality. But when you outright don't feel any attraction at all, and you feel it's a big enough scale to say \"this is a rule for how my sexuality works\", then that's just as important as defining it by gender. There's no reason to prioritize the gender definition over any other form, or to exclusively use gender, especially not when other forms are much better for you. \n\nOf course some people are going to get into nitty gritty detail, proclaiming new words for the smallest detail and deviation. But people already do that with the gender definitions: \"I have this type, only this specific type of hair body eye height like dislikes voice laugh\" etc, only that type is beautiful and everyone else is a pig for \"settling for less\".
