Capitalism doesn't care what color you are, all Capitalism cares is that you can get the job done. This is important to remember because you started this stating that there is some system called Racial Capitalism. To me it sounds like you were not given all the information and given a very biased view of Capitalism.\n\n&gt;African-Americans experience higher unemployment rates and higher incarceration rates than their white counterparts.\n\nI want you to ask the question 'why?' before anything else. In order to really answer this we have to unpack what is happening. We need to separate between our test and control. Our test being for blacks, and our control being for whites. Because what I am doing is essentially debunking systemic racism, you'll have to take this with a grain of salt because much of this has to do with definitions of words. It's a tangled mess and we're going to be here for a second.\n\nSo first off, what's the differences between blacks and whites? Well there are a few, and this only a applies to most, not all. \n\nWe know that both groups:\n\n* Have a different Culture\n* Look different\n* Speak different dialects\n* And act differently towards each other. \n\nThere are obviously other differences between these two races here in America, and different areas are going to be, well, different. I should also state that even people with the same race can come from a different culture. I, myself, coming from a more conservative town in the far north, am going to have a different outlook and strategy for success than you, who seems to come from a more liberal town. There's nothing wrong, they are just different places.\n\nThat being said, we need to identify what affects the two groups. The answer is all of them really, but what need to find what affects them the most. From this point on we come into speculation land, where we really have to use common sense and our own perspectives on life in order to come to a proper conclusion since there is no proper data that can prove this. All we can see are the effects, and never the cause, because the cause would have to have us rigorously study each case and compile the subjective term as racism and turn it into an objective one.\n\nI'm going to be making the case that the reason why we see crime increase and lower employment is because of their culture and how they are raised. I do have statistics that back this up, however they don't directly support these claims as all of them are simply heavily correlated.\n\nSo what do we know for sure about blacks in a cultural context?\n\n* We know that blacks are much more likely to be Fatherless (I'm pressed for time, so I'll have to send you these statistics at another time, or you can look them up yourself.)\n* We know that they are more likely to grow up in a single mother environment\n* We know that often times blacks will spite their own if they obtain success (This one I couldn't pull up a statistic, it's something that I've personally seen living with black friends and living in a black majority neighborhood)\n* We know that they distinguish themselves by speaking a different dialect and will spite their own that don't use this way of speaking by calling them \"Oreo\" (Same as the previous point)\n\nSo what does this leave us with? Well it seems a little obvious why crime is so high with this way of thinking and environment, and why they are over all more unsuccessful. There are other blacks who comment on this and notice the same patterns, seeing that instead of working on success they attack each other.\n\nYou could also reason that the business man doesn't care what color skin you have, all they care about is if you can earn them money. We saw this with the women's working movement, where women were willing to work for much less and literally took the jobs of their husbands on-mass. (This did actually happen, and again, after I take care of a few things I will gather up these citations or you can look them up yourself) If blacks were just as hard working but were willing to take a job for less money, blacks would be a preferred hire.\n\nSo is Capitalism racist? Not when there are other factors that can explain this that has evidence. You'd have to believe that most people are racist to even get anywhere and ignore the fact that the most powerful man in the country is black. He wasn't a pity hire, most people are genuinely are not racist and voted for him because they liked him. Not to mention that there are many other examples of blacks being able to become some of the wealthiest people in our society. (To remind you that the leader of the Mizzu protests is the son of a millionaire)\n\nBut that's all I have time for right now. There are so many other things that go counter to this notion that Capitalism is racist, but these are just a few.
