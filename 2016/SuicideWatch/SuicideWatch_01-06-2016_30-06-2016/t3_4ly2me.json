Sometimes making some extra cash running errands for friends of friends. I took another job, got laid off when they closed shop and left without a final paycheck. I was truly lucky to have family help however they could. I had friends that used my situation to take advantage of me and bilk what little money I had. I guess I&amp;#39;m trying to say there were ups and downs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;#39;t give up. I had a gift. Every second I stayed alive was a chance at a new experience. Every second I kept on going meant another chance things would turn around. People lifted me up and kept me on my feet. People knocked me down and told me to give up. I had to find what it was that kept picking me back up again, and for me, it was the experiences. The stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m married now. Who knew? She&amp;#39;s incredible.
