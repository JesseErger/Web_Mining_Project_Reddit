This is slightly different from an unintended slight, as the Actor is the source of Offended's plight.\n\nI might break it up into categories to define when someone's actions make the culpable for the Offended's reaction:\n\n1. Malice - if you intentionally say or do something hurtful, obviously you are culpable for any hurt feelings. It's also possible in this case for there to be an Offender without an Offended. If I say to you \"You are gay, right?\" with the intention of making you feel insecure, you may feel there is no insult, as your view is that it's simply an incorrect statement rather than an insult.

Inconsideration - More to the situation you described above, the Offender says something without thinking of the unintended ramifications of the statement. This is quite subjective though, as it relies heavily on what is *reasonable*. If an Actor order peanuts and the Offended bursts into tears because they lost a son to a peanut allergy, is the Actor culpable? Compare this to: an Actor saying \"addicts are responsible for their own poor situation\", with the Offended bursting into tears because of a family history of addiction. In both these situations, the Actor didn't mean to offend; also in both, the Actor *could* have thought \"this statement might cause unintended harm\". The difference is the probability; really, any statement or even silence could cause emotional harm, so it's logically impossible to know what will cause none (consider talking to 2 people - if you answer a yes/no question, either one will become offended, thereby making it impossible not to cause harm). I would suggest culpability stems from the likelihood, in context, that the person will be offended. In my mind, the addiction discussing Actor would be an Offender, whereas the peanut discussing Actor would not; in both cases, the Actor would be expected to apologize, but in neither are they explicitly admitting culpability.\n\nThe discussion of causing a scene, etc is separate in my mind, and in that situation the Actor and Offended change roles, and is distinct from the original action. Also, I don't think people in general think so logically in the situation; if they hurt someone, the knee-jerk reaction is to feel bad, even if you bear no moral responsibility (there was no way to know your action would cause harm).\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously we use apologies in our culture even when we bare no blame; &amp;quot;My mother died last week&amp;quot; -&amp;gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m so sorry!&amp;quot;.
