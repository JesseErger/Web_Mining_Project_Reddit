IMO its better just to learn critical thinking and break them down with their own ideas. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, lets say somebody trots out the classic &amp;quot;black peeple are only 12% of the population but comitment x% of the crime!!1!&amp;quot;. You can disprove that with stats but its easier just to say &amp;quot;black Americans overwhelmingly live in poverty; are you saying poor whites don&amp;#39;t commit crimes too? Are you saying black crime is distinct from &amp;#39;crime&amp;#39; as a category? Are you not opposed to all crime?&amp;quot;. Now they&amp;#39;re off to find the statistic, or to try and argue against simple logic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said, take it out of the debate mindset. Going off to find statistics to &amp;quot;disprove&amp;quot; these guys is impossible because there is always another study saying the exact opposite. Facts aren&amp;#39;t enough. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll repeat: &lt;strong&gt;Facts aren&amp;#39;t Enough&lt;/strong&gt;. We need to get above facts, below facts, into the abstract of rhetoric and logic. If somebody hits you with the crime statistic and you start dredging up more facts to disprove it, you&amp;#39;ve already lost the most important battle: are you debating on your terms, or on their terms? &amp;quot;Nuh-uh, Black people aren&amp;#39;t all criminals!!!1!&amp;quot; is debating on their terms. &amp;quot;Why should black crime be treated as exceptional?&amp;quot; is debating on our terms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t let them control the conversation is what I&amp;#39;m getting at.
