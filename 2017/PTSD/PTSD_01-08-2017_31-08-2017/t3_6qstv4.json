I was stopping and going between the breaths of humans crossing the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly a man&amp;#39;s face was inches from mine, both of his hands on either side of my open window, and he yelled angrily, &amp;quot;HELLO?!?&amp;quot; He was so close that I could smell the tobacco on his breath. He was a soldier, just a few years older than I was. I had probably almost hit him. I remember saying a few shakey sorry&amp;#39;s. don&amp;#39;t know what happened next, maybe his buddy tugged him away, or maybe he let go on his own.

I was dizzy, there was pain in my legs. I turned on my air conditioner at one point. I was too embarrassed to leave my car. I knew I had done something wrong, and I felt really humiliated for having such a bad reaction in public, for something which was my fault. I probably shouldn&amp;#39;t have driven, but I did. I drove myself home without running my errands, finished the attack I was having, drank, and fell asleep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was so strange. I haven&amp;#39;t reacted this way to something so minor in awhile. I hate it, I feel like I am being dramatic, even though I know it is uncontrollable. And I feel bad, for the soldier, because I didn&amp;#39;t see him. Normally I detach myself, the depression helps to keep me apathetic and distant in most situations.
