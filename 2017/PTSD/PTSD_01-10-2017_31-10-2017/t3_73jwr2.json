Honestly, since we got a dog I've felt safer because he will bark if anything out of the ordinary is happening.

I&amp;#39;ve felt that same kind of fear, it&amp;#39;s truly awful.\nUltimately you will find what works best for you, be it weed (try getting CBD oil if you can, it has zero psychoactive effects and in some cases was prescribed for children with health problems), therapy, meds etc. \nOne thing that I started doing after I worked my way from a 15 (if anxiety is 1 - 10, 15 would be panic attacks and the level of fear you are experiencing) to an 8, is I would kind of hold myself like I was my own mother (who never held me, so I&amp;#39;m trying to reparent myself). If I felt like I was experiencing anxiety of 8 or higher, I would gently cradle myself and slowly rock back and forth, making gentle shush-ing noises and saying &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s okay, it was a scary noise/a scary moment/just the wind, sshh love, you&amp;#39;re safe, it&amp;#39;s okay&amp;quot;. I would keep going until I was back down to my &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;, which is still higher than normal bit at least my &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; is more manageable than 10 or 15.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps you.
