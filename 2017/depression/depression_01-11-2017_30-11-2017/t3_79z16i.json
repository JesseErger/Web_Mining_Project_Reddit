I go to lectures, then go home. People tell me to join a club, i have, but its so boring and everyone is so clique cuz they join with their friends and its just bad. I study daily but i still dont do great on my courses. I feel like i just cant do anything anymore. I have friends, but not that many. Theyre always busy with life and school, i dont go out much cuz i dont have anyone to go out with, which tbh, is not that big of a deal, since i play games and im addicted to shows. But lately i just feel really down, I dont want to say depressed because i dont &amp;quot;REALLY&amp;#39; believe in first hand depression, where sad=depressed, because depression is alot worse and more complicated than that. But i see myself spiraling down. Im a very cynical person, Iv had a couple girlfriends ( I am 21 male, forgot to mention), and all have ended up with failures due to trust issues, mostly on my part. I feel like i have so much &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; to give, but i cant be loved back due to how i am. I have been betrayed/back stabbed my whole life , even by my parents and those experience alone just made me very cautious of trusting anyone or letting anyone get close type of thing. I dont work atm, because im trying to focus on school but that isnt even working either. I am more of a online type of person i might say, I like having online friends because its just easier to manage, they dont take that much responsibility as in seeing them often. even my current friends, I have lost 80% of my friends because of how i am. I ghost on them for weeks and months, and they just think i dont want to be friends with them. but thats just who i am. I love being myself and to myself, but i see now that gives the wrong impression and people drift away. With my cousins, we are very close, but we dont hang out outside of family, even though we are close age proximity. I am armenian, and my cousins hang out with alot of armenians, but i have drifted away from my cultural side, and the community because i did not like that community( church, community sports etc etc ). They were very judgy and talk behind your back type of people so i stayed away, which indirectly drifted me away from my cousins who hang out with them. I think this has turned into a rant but I just dont know what to do or think, Im spiraling out of control, i have random outburts of cries from just watching someone rescue a cat? and im like ????. I am a very soft male on the inside, but everyone says i dont show any emotions on the outside, maybe its just bottled up because no one ACTUALLY wants to know how youre doing, no one really cares, they cant help you, only you can help you. I have a &amp;quot;online gf&amp;quot; type of thing atm and now im like its never gonna work, no matter how well we work as our chemistry is, it just wont work due to distance, so that will eventually end and il just be more devastated. Everything is just in the back of my head all the time. I am a very observant individual, i am aware of alot of social and societal influences and trajectory of individuals based on current actions. I always have thoughts of my family members dying, like how their death will impact me emotionally, and that to me is just very weird. I am aware of my issues as a person, but i just cant do anything about it.I know this is a very long post but i just needed to let it all out while im studying for my STATS test. \nTLDR: Trying to do school, not doing great, alot of emotional problems, no job because i dont know, I dont have anything going for me other than my emotional personality that apparently girls are attracted to because i am a &amp;quot;Ideal husband &amp;quot;.
