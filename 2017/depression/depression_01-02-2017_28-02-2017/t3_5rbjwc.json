I have been having depression and anxiety and jealousy too. I feel like i have no friends at community. All my cousins and everyone i know including my girlfriend went away to UNI. I feel that i am missing on drinking and partying like my cousins , twin brother , girlfriend and everyone else does in UNI while I&amp;#39;m at Community college after 2 years not drinking and going to frat parties and stuff . My cousins , my girlfriend of 2 1/2 years , my twin brother goes to UNI and they make new friends and party too , It&amp;#39;s not fair to me and i am jealous of it too. I want to have alot of great friends and drinking parties with Frats and soloritys too at a UNI just like them and have a fun college experience. I feel like giving up ,also i have speech problem too that makes me hard to say some words and sounds so i think most people will not want to be friends because of that too in school too. I have almost no friends at the Community college too . My girlfriend not talking to me after we had a fight is not helping too. If you read my other posts , you can add your advice to your post on this thread too with advice on this thread. Also i didn&amp;#39;t get good grades in the last 2 years too especially math too in the last 2 years because i was with my gf and stuff. i feel like giving up at this point , because i figured i will not be like them and have no friends from college and drink and have fun at parties with friends like them . Everytime i try to work hard , i always fail too so that adds to it so to me hard work does not pay off at all too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Also i feel like i will not make any friends and party with at frats and stuff after i transfer out of my Community College too because of my speech problem. Along with that i changed my major at my community college too so i can become Medical doctor too , CRNA or a engineer too , my family says I&amp;#39;m not smart enough because i need help in school and I&amp;#39;m not good in math too . i had 4-8 friends in high school too that i hang out with after in HS. I really never tried in school too so I&amp;#39;m trying to do better too so i can go to a big UNI and drink at frat/ solor parties and stuff like most people do in college\nany advice will be helpful.\n Thanks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi, So i am 22 years old and my name is Jake.
