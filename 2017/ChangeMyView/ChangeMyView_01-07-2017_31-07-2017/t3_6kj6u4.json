The argument you produce here is that it's more expensive for companies to hire employees that cost more money, however a majority of the current state leave laws don't require this money to come out of employer's pockets.\n\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act already states that employees must be granted protected leave for qualified medical and family reasons (i.e. personal of family illness, pregnancy, adoption, etc.)\nThis law doesn't require said leave be paid, however 3 states *do* currently require some form of paid leave, these states being California, Rhode Island, and New Jersey. New York also has a paid family leave law that goes into effect on January 1st, 2018 and the District of Columbia has a paid family leave law scheduled to go into effect on July 1st, 2020. If we break these laws down state by state, you'll see most of these laws don't require this paid leave to be paid fully by employers.\n\nCalifornia's paid leave states that \"Paid family leave is funded through deductions from employee paychecks.\" (as long as these employees still receive minimum wage) (nolo.com)\n\nNew Jersey's law specifies that \"Paid family leave is funded through deductions from employee paychecks, not through employer contributions.\" (nolo.com)\n\nRhode Island has its own Temporary Caregiver Insurance, which \"is administered by the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training\u2019s Temporary Disability Insurance Division, and is financed entirely by employee payroll deductions. (smallbusinessmajority.org)\n\nAs far as the family leave programs in progress, New York's leave is \"paid by the state, not by employers. The program is funded through payroll deductions from employee paychecks.\" The program that the District of Columbia has in progress will also be \"run by the city and funded through employer payroll taxes.\" (nolo.com)\n\nYour second article does indeed discuss that family leave might not be paid for by employers, stating:\n\n&gt; But where are these costs shifted to? The answer would be obvious if the Trump administration were planning to force employers to keep paying the wages of workers who take leave. But that\u2019s probably not how it would be done. The wages would likely be paid through state unemployment programs, and we don\u2019t yet know how the money would be raised. Regardless of the method, however, unintended consequences would follow. A tax on employers or employees would of course mean lower wages, so the tax burden would not be confined to women, who are more likely than men to take parental leave. The same would be true if the money were taken from general revenues. (However, with the budget deficit, that would require more borrowing and higher taxes later, reducing take-home pay later.) But no matter how the money is raised, female job applicants would be specifically harmed because their months-long absence with a guaranteed job on return would disrupt business. Employers might have to train temporary workers or other staff members. (Thus, even the current federal policy of unpaid leave under the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act is costly.) Since women are more likely to take leave than men, employers would expect that, other things equal, hiring a man would likely be less costly than hiring a woman. So they would hire fewer women or pay them less than men. In a word, TANSTAAFL.\n\nThere's a couple flaws with these 2 paragraphs.\n\n&gt; paid through state unemployment programs, and we don\u2019t yet know how the money would be raised.\n\nAs we addressed earlier, all 5 current programs currently plan to or already raise the money via payroll deductions, so the notion a federally paid leave law has an uncertain basis for funding is simply false.\n\n&gt; A tax on employers or employees would of course mean lower wages, so the tax burden would not be confined to women, who are more likely than men to take parental leave.\n\nAbout that. A) A family leave law IS NOT a parental leave law. While it is true that pregnancy is a reason for qualified leave under many of these current laws, a lot of these laws simply require either a man or woman to have a new child in the family, born or adopted, and many paid family leaves aren't about new members of the family, rather current members of the family facing serious illness. The notion that these laws disproportionately help or burden one sex is false, as OP states themselves, so the notion requiring a tax burden to support these laws is unfair is painfully ignorant.\n\n&gt; no matter how the money is raised, female job applicants would be specifically harmed because their months-long absence with a guaranteed job on return would disrupt business. Employers might have to train temporary workers or other staff members. (Thus, even the current federal policy of unpaid leave under the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act is costly.) \n\nTo suggest the FMLA is a bad law is an entirely different debate, and paid leave laws and the FMLA are entirely separate pieces of legislation. This article provides no proof paid leave laws increase work absence, and I agree that this proof is indeed necessary when people can already take unpaid leave, applying for these benefits and having a situation where these benefits are applicable doesn't occur very often, and usually would indeed have an employee file for leave regardless of whether it's paid or not, not to mention these events drastically reduce an employee's productivity whether they leave at all.\n \n&gt; Since women are more likely to take leave than men, employers would expect that, other things equal, hiring a man would likely be less costly than hiring a woman. So they would hire fewer women or pay them less than men.\n\nLast issue, wage gap. I don't tire on with this one as it's an entirely different point and debate, but do consider this is a measurable economic effect and that even if you don't believe in it, many employees and even employers do, employers who study economic trends and could still easily believe that a women would indeed be cheaper to hire than a man.\n\nThose are my three main points.\n\ntldr; Leave hardly ever comes out of the employer's pockets, work absence will work regardless and drop in productivity will occur regardless of FMLA or paid leave, and the wage gap is still an effect that should be taking in mind when trying to argue women are becoming more expensive to hire than women.
