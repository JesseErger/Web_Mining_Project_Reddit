Let me give you a question.\n\nYou have a business selling lemon-aid. The stand sells a dollar a cup, and usually sells around 100 cups a day. Your competition doesn't do as well as you because you have a good hold on the market and you personally market the business, though your products are very similar. They might sell 85 cups compared to your 100 cups, and they sell theirs for the same price. You have one employee, whom you pay $4/hour. He works a 6 hour shift and sells 25 cups an hour on average. Cups cost 5 cents, the lemons, sugar and water to make 100 cups cost around 10$, and last but not least, you have to set aside enough money for rent of the stand, maintenance and other expenses such as uniforms and tools, which we'll call $400 / month or around $100 a week. Meaning that your profit for a week will total out to around $500 - $120 for labor - $25 for cups - $50 for materials - $125 for other =  $180 for yourself and other business ventures you might want to engage in. You're not making a massive profit, not enough to open up another stand any time soon, but you can manage the stand you own and still make more than a decent living given the current economy. You might put 60 into a fund for another stand, which you might be able to get in a year or so, and use the other 120 to live off of. \n\nThen, the minimum wage raises to the tune of $2. This means that your labor now costs $180. How do you balance this without falling bellow your own current wage, savings for a new stand that would help net you more cash to use during problem seasons of the business? It's simple, you cut hours. You decide that Monday morning is a great start, selling a decent amount, but that later on in the afternoon, you don't sell as much. So you cut Monday to 4 hours, you cut Tuesday to 2 hours because that's your lowest day, keep Wednesday at 6, cut Thursday down to 4 hours, and you do the same for Friday. So now your employee, despite the wage increase, has his hours cut by 8 hours, going from 30 hours a week, to 20. And his wage, which was 120, doesn't raise at all. He would object, but other businesses are doing the same. And now comes the worst part, you have to increase sales on these hours, which is doable but it means you'll have to work harder and so will your employee.\n\nAn alternative is to raise the price of your goods, which will cause inflation because other businesses will do the same.\n\nI know this isn't a large scale, but the math on that would literally take me hours and it's not worth it for this conversation. Side note, this does have some bearing because small businesses are affected by minimum wage hikes. Please understand that there are better ways to help the poor than to raise the min wage. It hurts people because companies, businesses, and corporations must all do one of these two things since changing any of the other numbers would either mean stagnation and eventually death for their business, or wouldn't have as much of an effect given the cost of doing that.\n\n&gt;But that is why there is minimum wage in place, because corporations tried to pay their lower workers the bare minimum to increase profits. This article shows how corporations are using various methods to keep their bottom line the lowest they can.\n\nLike this, this is correct, but it's directly because there were increases to the min wage.
