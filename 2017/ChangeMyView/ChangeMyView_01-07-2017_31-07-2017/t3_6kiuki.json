And simulating gravitational effect can be achieved by rotating the ship at a certain velocity.  This is first year physics: centripetal motion.\n\n&gt;Humans need a complex chemical diet, which would need to be synthesized\n\nHow hard do you think it would be to harvest cultivated food grown aboard the ship?\n\n&gt;Humans are vulnerable to radiation\n\nWell, certain wavelengths or a certain concentration, sure, but not all electromagnetic radiation is harmful.\n\n&gt;which will be a constant issue from both cosmic background noise\n\nNot really, since you're exposed to the Cosmic Background Radiation anyway.  Since it isn't ionizing, it's not an issue.  Period.\n\n&gt;the propulsion system\n\nAlso not really.  The only time the propulsion system emitting radiation would actually be a problem is if you were directly in front of a nuclear based propulsion system while it was going off.  However, and rightfully so, that particular concept never really caught on with the mainstream scientific community, due to concerns that once you set off a nuclear explosion, it turned the ship into a bullet, presenting a problem for stopping, slowing down, and just not running into things at high velocities.  Newton's First Law still applies, that an object in motion will remain in motion until acted on by a force of equal or greater magnitude -- and so, this sort of leads me to another rejection of the point, that once you reach a particular speed, it's no longer necessary to keep the propulsion system on continuously.  It's not like there's anything in the vacuum of space, save gravity or solid objects, that might cause you to just slow down.\n\n&gt;excrete toxic waste, which would need to be processed\n\nOr just expelled from the system.\n\n&gt;Suspended humans would need continuous maintenance and a complex recovery process\n\nWell, that's not entirely true, since we've never successfully caused someone to enter suspended animation of the sorts seen in sci fi.  However, a much simpler solution is to either take advantage of time dilation while traveling shorter distances by making ships capable of approaching higher fractions of the speed of light.  Another solution is to skip that approach entirely and plan the sojourn around multiple generations if necessary.  \n\n&gt;Any destination planet would need to be terraformed for humans to inhabit\n\nNot exactly.  In fact, astronomers have spotted a variety of planets similar to Earth that aren't relatively far from our solar system (operative phrase being \"relatively\").  Many of these planets likely have similar atmospheric conditions, similar chemical makeup, ie, similar abundance of organic molecules, but certainly have similar climates, size, mass, and water concentration, perhaps even with functional magnetosphere and life of its own.  The only planets or moons we might need to terraform are if we were to decide to avoid any of these habitable planets within the Goldilocks Zone of their star and just inhabit an uninhabitable planet, which would be grossly impractical. \n\n&gt;Hundreds of humans, at minimum, must survive the journey and breed in a regimented system to ensure genetic diversity.\n\nTens of thousands, actually.  A population of only a few hundred would be likely to suffer at the hands of genetic drift and inbreeding depression.  Which is bad.\n\n&gt;Universal seeding, or dispersing single-celled organisms to hopefully evolve into intelligent organisms on other planets, doesn't constitute space colonization, since all information of our civilization is lost.\n\nOkay, so if \"information of our civilization\" is all that matters, if we send a few ships out to colonize some distant planet, and by the time the ship gets there, everyone who remembered Earth or any of its civilizations with clarity had died off, would that still not count?\n\n&gt;My view is that the Star Trek idea of city-sized arks with an entire multigenerational civilization onboard, building a second Earth, is absurd.\n\nThe problem is that you're criticizing sci fi while pretending to criticize real world things (with something that's equally rooted in sci fi, mind you), but it's not even from a good perspective.

This is first year physics: centripetal motion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Humans need a complex chemical diet, which would need to be synthesized&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How hard do you think it would be to harvest cultivated food grown aboard the ship?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Humans are vulnerable to radiation&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, certain wavelengths or a certain concentration, sure, but not all electromagnetic radiation is harmful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;which will be a constant issue from both cosmic background noise&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not really, since you&amp;#39;re exposed to the Cosmic Background Radiation anyway.  Since it isn&amp;#39;t ionizing, it&amp;#39;s not an issue.  Period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;the propulsion system&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also not really.  The only time the propulsion system emitting radiation would actually be a problem is if you were directly in front of a nuclear based propulsion system while it was going off.  However, and rightfully so, that particular concept never really caught on with the mainstream scientific community, due to concerns that once you set off a nuclear explosion, it turned the ship into a bullet, presenting a problem for stopping, slowing down, and just not running into things at high velocities.  Newton&amp;#39;s First Law still applies, that an object in motion will remain in motion until acted on by a force of equal or greater magnitude -- and so, this sort of leads me to another rejection of the point, that once you reach a particular speed, it&amp;#39;s no longer necessary to keep the propulsion system on continuously.  It&amp;#39;s not like there&amp;#39;s anything in the vacuum of space, save gravity or solid objects, that might cause you to just slow down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;excrete toxic waste, which would need to be processed&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or just expelled from the system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Suspended humans would need continuous maintenance and a complex recovery process&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;#39;s not entirely true, since we&amp;#39;ve never successfully caused someone to enter suspended animation of the sorts seen in sci fi.  However, a much simpler solution is to either take advantage of time dilation while traveling shorter distances by making ships capable of approaching higher fractions of the speed of light.  Another solution is to skip that approach entirely and plan the sojourn around multiple generations if necessary.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Any destination planet would need to be terraformed for humans to inhabit&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not exactly.  In fact, astronomers have spotted a variety of planets similar to Earth that aren&amp;#39;t relatively far from our solar system (operative phrase being &amp;quot;relatively&amp;quot;).  Many of these planets likely have similar atmospheric conditions, similar chemical makeup, ie, similar abundance of organic molecules, but certainly have similar climates, size, mass, and water concentration, perhaps even with functional magnetosphere and life of its own.  The only planets or moons we might need to terraform are if we were to decide to avoid any of these habitable planets within the Goldilocks Zone of their star and just inhabit an uninhabitable planet, which would be grossly impractical. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of humans, at minimum, must survive the journey and breed in a regimented system to ensure genetic diversity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands, actually.  A population of only a few hundred would be likely to suffer at the hands of genetic drift and inbreeding depression.  Which is bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Universal seeding, or dispersing single-celled organisms to hopefully evolve into intelligent organisms on other planets, doesn&amp;#39;t constitute space colonization, since all information of our civilization is lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, so if &amp;quot;information of our civilization&amp;quot; is all that matters, if we send a few ships out to colonize some distant planet, and by the time the ship gets there, everyone who remembered Earth or any of its civilizations with clarity had died off, would that still not count?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My view is that the Star Trek idea of city-sized arks with an entire multigenerational civilization onboard, building a second Earth, is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is that you&amp;#39;re criticizing sci fi while pretending to criticize real world things (with something that&amp;#39;s equally rooted in sci fi, mind you), but it&amp;#39;s not even from a good perspective.  I mean, at this point, why not argue over which Space Opera franchise was better?

You assume that we can fabricate a way to reach relativistic speeds, and not engineer a way around this? We've already invented Submarines which are capable of insulting humans from amounts of pressure that would otherwise kill them. Portability comes with innovation in this regard.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;Humans need a complex chemical diet, which would need to be synthesized, and excrete toxic waste, which would need to be processed. An artificial being could subsist on virtually any energy source, with waste heat redirected into propulsion.\n\nWe've already come to a point where we have distilled a good amount of human essentials into small pills called vitamins. That and dehydrated MRE's already exist for both portability and sustainability. But again, your jump in logic that we could achieve relativistic speeds and not get around this seems inconsistent regardless.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;Humans are vulnerable to radiation, which will be a constant issue from both cosmic background noise and the propulsion system. Artificial beings can be radiation-hardened and repair damage to maintain their integrity. In addition, their smaller cross-section reduces exposure.\n\nHumans don't have to be the ones exposing themselves to the elements. We can dispatch robots to do that. After all, we are far closer to sentient AI than we are to getting out of the universe.\n\n&gt;&gt;Suspended humans would need continuous maintenance and a complex recovery process. Artificial beings can be paused and resumed at will during the long journey.\n\n\nThis is a bit speculative. While there is certainly some validity to the idea behind cryostasis on your end it certainly isn't the only option. If we were really committed to space travel, we could build colony style ships that house generations of people, so cryogenics are not a mandatory component of the equation. \n\n&gt;&gt;Any destination planet would need to be terraformed for humans to inhabit. Not only would the ship need to carry a general-purpose terraformer, but it would need to remain in orbit for possibly millennia while terraforming completes. Even if it succeeds, minor differences in ecosystems or planetary composition could make it worthless.\n\nThis is not inherently true. After all, We won a sufficiently random lottery with Earth. We don't even need to look at every planet, we can start with ones that house even short term sustainable conditions and move from there.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;Hundreds of humans, at minimum, must survive the journey and breed in a regimented system to ensure genetic diversity. An arbitrary number of artificial beings can be procedurally generated by a single algorithm.\n\nI've already sufficiently answered this above.\n\n\nUltimately your view is just as speculative as any other, and it's pretty self evident that there are numerous solutions to issues you present. The fact of the matter is, it's impossible to progress the argument further than that.\n\nYour way would certainly be the most simplistic in the here and now, but you don't even have a full grasp of the actual problems we face because nobody else does either.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Minute changes in gravitational force, pressure, atmosphere, day/night cycles, social dynamics, etc significantly damage human physiology.

Portability comes with innovation in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Humans need a complex chemical diet, which would need to be synthesized, and excrete toxic waste, which would need to be processed. An artificial being could subsist on virtually any energy source, with waste heat redirected into propulsion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve already come to a point where we have distilled a good amount of human essentials into small pills called vitamins. That and dehydrated MRE&amp;#39;s already exist for both portability and sustainability. But again, your jump in logic that we could achieve relativistic speeds and not get around this seems inconsistent regardless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Humans are vulnerable to radiation, which will be a constant issue from both cosmic background noise and the propulsion system. Artificial beings can be radiation-hardened and repair damage to maintain their integrity. In addition, their smaller cross-section reduces exposure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Humans don&amp;#39;t have to be the ones exposing themselves to the elements. We can dispatch robots to do that. After all, we are far closer to sentient AI than we are to getting out of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Suspended humans would need continuous maintenance and a complex recovery process. Artificial beings can be paused and resumed at will during the long journey.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a bit speculative. While there is certainly some validity to the idea behind cryostasis on your end it certainly isn&amp;#39;t the only option. If we were really committed to space travel, we could build colony style ships that house generations of people, so cryogenics are not a mandatory component of the equation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Any destination planet would need to be terraformed for humans to inhabit. Not only would the ship need to carry a general-purpose terraformer, but it would need to remain in orbit for possibly millennia while terraforming completes. Even if it succeeds, minor differences in ecosystems or planetary composition could make it worthless.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not inherently true. After all, We won a sufficiently random lottery with Earth. We don&amp;#39;t even need to look at every planet, we can start with ones that house even short term sustainable conditions and move from there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of humans, at minimum, must survive the journey and breed in a regimented system to ensure genetic diversity. An arbitrary number of artificial beings can be procedurally generated by a single algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve already sufficiently answered this above.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately your view is just as speculative as any other, and it&amp;#39;s pretty self evident that there are numerous solutions to issues you present. The fact of the matter is, it&amp;#39;s impossible to progress the argument further than that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your way would certainly be the most simplistic in the here and now, but you don&amp;#39;t even have a full grasp of the actual problems we face because nobody else does either.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_djml6sr", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/6kiuki/cmv_biological_humans_are_incapable_of_colonizing/djml6sr/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1498896220.0, "author_flair_text": "69\u2206", "created_utc": 1498867420.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6kiuki", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6kiuki", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6kiuki", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "djmloop", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ardonpitt", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_djmjppe", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt; Biological life does adapt, but over thousands of generations under selection pressure.
