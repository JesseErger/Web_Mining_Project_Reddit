There are extremist outliers in the trans community, but those folk are beyond ridiculous and immature and a lot of trans folk take great exception to allowing them to represent us.\n\nBut many feminist issues are of extreme importance to trans issues for a variety of reasons. For example, just yesterday I got a nice little creepy comment from my neighbor who had for six months payed entirely too much attention to me, made me extremely uncomfortable, and made me afraid to walk out my front door if its dark. He behaves this way because he perceives me as a woman. He is not aware that I'm a trans woman. Despite the biological differences between myself and a cis woman, I'm still being subjected to much of the sexist baggage cis women face. Trans women still get raped (at statistically marginally higher rates than cis women, actually) and trans women still end up in abusive relationships. Cis-blending trans women still deal with sexist/misogynist attitudes in the work place. You can see where trans women may feel like they need a seat at the feminist table, no?\n\nLet's take your infertility page. Many many MANY trans women I know struggle with the fact that they cannot be biological mothers. Most of them sacrificed even male fertility in order to be able to transition (hint: I'm one of them). This can be just as difficult for them as it is for any cisgender woman struggling with infertility. In fact I have a cisgender friend who is infertile and her and I have often bonded over our mutual inability be biological mother's and our desire to eventually adopt. It would be downright petty for a cisgender woman to boot a trans woman out of a place of mutual support for infertility issues because the cis woman felt \"put upon\" by the trans woman's presence there.\n\nThe fundamental problem is the insistence by *some* groups of cisgender women that trans women even so much as identifying as women is an imposition on women. Once woman recently told me that expecting a trans woman's pronouns to be respected in the work place created a hostile work environment for [cis] women.

There are extremist outliers in the trans community, but those folk are beyond ridiculous and immature and a lot of trans folk take great exception to allowing them to represent us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But many feminist issues are of extreme importance to trans issues for a variety of reasons. For example, just yesterday I got a nice little creepy comment from my neighbor who had for six months payed entirely too much attention to me, made me extremely uncomfortable, and made me afraid to walk out my front door if its dark. He behaves this way because he perceives me as a woman. He is not aware that I&amp;#39;m a trans woman. Despite the biological differences between myself and a cis woman, I&amp;#39;m still being subjected to much of the sexist baggage cis women face. Trans women still get raped (at statistically marginally higher rates than cis women, actually) and trans women still end up in abusive relationships. Cis-blending trans women still deal with sexist/misogynist attitudes in the work place. You can see where trans women may feel like they need a seat at the feminist table, no?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take your infertility page. Many many MANY trans women I know struggle with the fact that they cannot be biological mothers. Most of them sacrificed even male fertility in order to be able to transition (hint: I&amp;#39;m one of them). This can be just as difficult for them as it is for any cisgender woman struggling with infertility. In fact I have a cisgender friend who is infertile and her and I have often bonded over our mutual inability be biological mother&amp;#39;s and our desire to eventually adopt. It would be downright petty for a cisgender woman to boot a trans woman out of a place of mutual support for infertility issues because the cis woman felt &amp;quot;put upon&amp;quot; by the trans woman&amp;#39;s presence there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fundamental problem is the insistence by &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; groups of cisgender women that trans women even so much as identifying as women is an imposition on women. Once woman recently told me that expecting a trans woman&amp;#39;s pronouns to be respected in the work place created a hostile work environment for [cis] women. I&amp;#39;m sure you can see how dramatic and histrionic this is, no?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_djn81hs", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/6kj5xm/cmv_there_are_inherent_differences_in_the_issues/djn81hs/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1498943058.0, "author_flair_text": "13\u2206", "created_utc": 1498914258.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 5, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6kj5xm", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6kj5xm", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6kj5xm", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6kj5xm", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6kj5xm", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "djotryo", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "aggsalad", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_djot57m", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I do not see how that is a *meaningful* distinction.
