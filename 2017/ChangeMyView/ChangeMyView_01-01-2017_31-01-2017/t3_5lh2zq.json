It is a rhetoric often used by male supremacists, to detract from the message feminists send, and it speaks on a gut level to everyone. the first reaction to \"my side has these issues\", will usually be \"yes but my side has issues as well!\", no matter what the issue is.\n\nNow, it is very difficult to read your mind(we're still working on that technology i'm afraid), so my apologies if i'm completely off base here. But i do want to ask you to consider this for a moment and reflect for yourself: do you really view that the \"male\" side of the issue is too far undervalued?

Only in this case, i'm really not sure whether the answer is \"yes, we should focus on female rape above male rape, because it is so much more prevalent\", or \"no, both sides have it bad, and even though female rape might be a bit more prevalent, for men it is just as bad because people don't even realize men can be raped\".", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this world, the good of challenging consent myths that affect women has to be weighed against the bad of reinforcing another harmful and all-too-common myth: the notion that men can&amp;#39;t be raped.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really like how you worded this, and i think we can pretty much agree on this.

Or does this maybe have to do with a reflex where your gut reaction is &amp;quot;yes, females have a problem, but don&amp;#39;t forget the male issues as well!&amp;quot;, even though the problems are of a completely different magnitude?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This argument is not really meant to change your view on the topic itself, since even with considering all of the above, i assume we&amp;#39;d still end up both agreeing with the view you wrote down above.(weigh the harm&amp;amp;benefits of mentioning both genders) Rather, i do hope you consider whether or not this view might be too influenced by the gut reaction &amp;quot;yes, but don&amp;#39;t forget men&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because in the end, the above argument holds not just for feminism, but for any topic where a &amp;quot;minority&amp;quot; is talking about their issues. anyones gut reaction will be to ask &amp;quot;yes, but while your minority group may have issues, please don&amp;#39;t ignore the issues my majority group has!&amp;quot;. only after carefully thinking about it is it possible to decide whether it really is fair to argue for a more neutral argumentation, or if the discrepancy between the groups is big enough that it&amp;#39;s fine to ignore the &amp;quot;empowered&amp;quot; side&amp;#39; issues for the &amp;quot;minority&amp;quot; issues. Only in this case, i&amp;#39;m really not sure whether the answer is &amp;quot;yes, we should focus on female rape above male rape, because it is so much more prevalent&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;no, both sides have it bad, and even though female rape might be a bit more prevalent, for men it is just as bad because people don&amp;#39;t even realize men can be raped&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbvzkso", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lh2zq/cmvaccepting_for_the_sake_of_argument_that_there/dbvzkso/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483351586.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483322786.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbvxp71", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Impacatus", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dbvuvp4", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Interesting approach to the question.

Obviously it's bad, and obviously people should be punished for it. But the *epidemic* is rape against women. Those statistics are higher than normal crime statistics. 90% of adult rape victims are female. 82% of child victims are female. This acknowledges male rape. Girls under 19 are **four** times as likely to be raped than any other group. 1 in 6 women have been a victim of an attempted or completed rape. This is more than people (men and women) who are targets of common credit card identity theft. Rape against women does not represent \"normal\" crime statistics.

That&amp;#39;s not appropriate to point out apparently. Violent rape, sex slavery, domestic abuse happen to both genders, but how can you ignore that for &lt;strong&gt;centuries&lt;/strong&gt; and throughout all of history, they&amp;#39;ve disproportionately happened to women by men? Men and women both need rights, but it seems like &amp;quot;men&amp;#39;s rights&amp;quot; consist of denying misogyny exists and/or saying &amp;quot;it happens to us too&amp;quot;. Reminds me of &amp;quot;All Lives Matter&amp;quot;, or a better example, complaining about your IBS to someone with cancer and thinking it&amp;#39;s the same thing. There are so many valid problems in the world, and we can acknowledge them all, but you don&amp;#39;t combat them by comparing them to others. You can&amp;#39;t compare the rape statistics of men to the rape statistics of women. They&amp;#39;re worlds apart. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The statistics on male rape are not astronomical. It&amp;#39;s a crime, and crime is going to happen. Obviously it&amp;#39;s bad, and obviously people should be punished for it. But the &lt;em&gt;epidemic&lt;/em&gt; is rape against women. Those statistics are higher than normal crime statistics. 90% of adult rape victims are female. 82% of child victims are female. This acknowledges male rape. Girls under 19 are &lt;strong&gt;four&lt;/strong&gt; times as likely to be raped than any other group. 1 in 6 women have been a victim of an attempted or completed rape. This is more than people (men and women) who are targets of common credit card identity theft. Rape against women does not represent &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; crime statistics. That is why you see more campaigns to stop rape against women (which often even include men).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbwm2zi", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lh2zq/cmvaccepting_for_the_sake_of_argument_that_there/dbwm2zi/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483401202.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483372402.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}]
