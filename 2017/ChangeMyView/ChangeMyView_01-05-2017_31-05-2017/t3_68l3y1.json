The rich continue to get richer because people still need to pay them for food and rent and so on, and the poor are slightly less poor. People are generally more comfortable, so the risk of revolution lowers and politicians are placed under less pressure to further reduce inequality.

Feel free to dismiss as crackpot ramblings.\n___\n\nEssentially, yes. I am proposing straight up communism, though I'm sure many would disagree with my terminology. I would like to see a society in which certain assets---food, water, housing, healthcare, education, whatever else you deem essential to a full, dignified life---are considered as basic human rights, and are supplied outside of the traditional market. I'll focus on food here in my examples, because I find it the easiest to conceptualise.\n\nFirst, we note that [we produce more than enough food to feed the world](http://www.worldhunger.org/2015-world-hunger-and-poverty-facts-and-statistics/#produce1): people starve because food is distributed unevenly, not because of a global deficit. The reason hundreds of thousands of people are likely to starve to death this year in South Sudan is not down to global scarcity.\n\nSo how do we get food to people without the market, and why should we? I'll focus on developed nations here, because the infrastructure is already in place.\n\nThe \"why\" is fairly obvious: at each stage between the ground and your table (and beyond; someone has to produce the fertilisers, machinery, fuel and so on) everyone needs to extract a profit, and everyone is encouraged to extract as much profit as possible from everyone else on the supply chain. You can end up with dirt-poor farmers at one end of the supply chain and massively profitable supermarket chains at the other end. The supermarket chain will only promise not to exploit those earlier in the supply chain (\"fair trade\") when required to do so by law or consumer opinion. If food is considered a fundamental right, then it makes sense to reduce inefficiencies in the supply chain as much as possible, and each step of profit-gouging is an added inefficiency.\n\nThe \"how\" is already in place: we are no longer limited to relying on distributed, decentralised supply chains, where each supplier in the chain only has enough information to optimise their processes according to those immediately preceding or succeeding them. Similarly, we are no longer limited to the monolithic, opaque, biased and sometimes [actively evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor) Soviet system, in which unaccountable bureaucrats \"fairly\" distribute goods.\n\nNow, if you go to your supermarket of choice and buy an apple, that is part of a well-known supply chain quantified all the way back to the orchard. The supermarket knows who grew the apple, who transported it, where the greatest demand for apples is, how to efficiently arrange warehouses, where to route trucks to minimise fuel usage and empty loads. I propose that the state does the same job, from the production of fertiliser and tools to regional distribution. The goal moves away from the piecemeal goals of each link in the supply chain (\"make a profit on selling my product or services\") to a single goal (\"make sure everyone is fed\"). Running the entire process allows more rigorous optimisation than can currently be applied.\n\nTraditionally, this would lead to corruption, unfair distribution and possibly worse food distribution problems than before, but technology offers the ability to oversee and democratise the process in ways that weren't possible in the 1930s when Stalin was busy starving the Ukrainians. Supply chains are already monitored and managed: if all details of the state-run supply chain are published in real time (and all code involved is published so that it can be properly vetted), distribution can be made truly equitable by exposing any inefficiencies or biases. Researchers could track pig iron to blast furnace to factory to machinery to field to truck to warehouse to distribution centre (and in aggregate to table, but there are obvious privacy issues involved in fine-grain tracking of that sort). When an inefficiency is identified or an improvement is developed, some busy researcher will point it out, and it can be fixed.\n\nOne of the most obvious problems of this is labour: who tills the fields or drives the trucks? I don't know, and I doubt anybody does. I suspect some of the jobs could be automated away, and some will be filled by volunteers, but it's not clear how far automation will take us and there are limits as to what people will volunteer for, even when they don't need to hold down a 9--5 job. I like the idea of periods of civil service every few years. It's not too uncommon an idea for one-off periods(e.g. Singapore), but I suspect many people would consider this an appropriation of labour far too overreaching and authoritarian.\n\nThis doesn't mean that we need to get rid of personal wealth, or that there can't be traditional markets operating in parallel. If someone finds state-produced goods or services, they can shop elsewhere. If someone builds a $700 bag squeezer and raises millions of venture capital, good for them. It would, hopefully, ameliorate some of the worst excesses of the current system, in which the ultra-rich get richer by exploiting resources used by everybody.\n\nWe could move towards this system gradually, without revolution. A good first start would be increasing the transparency of services already run by the government: all developed nations offer some form of social program, be it healthcare, state pension or education.
