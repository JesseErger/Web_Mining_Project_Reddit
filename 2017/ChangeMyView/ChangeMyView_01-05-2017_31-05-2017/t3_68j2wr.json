So the first issue I have is the word &amp;#39;Communism&amp;#39; has too much of a negative connotation to it and associating myself with it ruins any chance to have proper political discussions. Issue number two is quite simply I don&amp;#39;t know if I believe in Communism anymore. To elaborate, I don&amp;#39;t think my views have changed. I believe in and are a strong advocate for large governments. Health care is a right, not a privilege. There is plenty to go around. When peaceful protests fail, the workers should turn to violent revolts. Etc. etc.  But.. I don&amp;#39;t think I should associate myself with communism nor advocate for it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is I feel I&amp;#39;ve become profoundly close minded in my views of world politics. It seems now whenever politics comes up and I have a discussion, it always turns south. I get caught up in things, start getting more drastic about my views. To give an example, I once argued with someone on why I dislike all of the Marvel films. It ended with me going on about how working class is oppressed and Disney is wasting money instead of feeding the poor or something like that. I believe I&amp;#39;ve become close minded through Communism because its such a hated political system and, as a result, you either become firm or take shit from everyone for your views. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to be close minded as it goes against everything I believe in. So I want to change my perspective on political beliefs. I don&amp;#39;t see myself abandoning socialist values and programs. That is just who I am as an individual. But I can&amp;#39;t keep being such a close minded person who can&amp;#39;t even have a simple debate because of my irrationality. I need to abandon Communism - even if it once gave me the hope I needed to go day to day.

That meant factories, farms, and other big expensive things. But in the modern service economy there is no centralized means of production. You don't need a recording contract, you can just make music and post it to Sound Cloud. You don't need a TV show, you can just make something and post it to Youtube. You don't need a $200,000 taxi medallion to drive people around, you can just join something like Uber or Lyft. \n\nJobs are now based on skills that people have, not on what expensive machines they own. There's two obvious arguments agains this. First, there are still a ton of things in life where owning certain things (oil, gold, factories, etc.) does make you more powerful. That's true, but it's less so than at any other time in history and it's moving in that direction everyday. Intellectual capital is the most important thing today, and no one can steal your brain from you. Next, you could argue that now companies like Sound Cloud, Youtube, Uber, and Lyft are becoming more powerful. That's true, but it doesn't take a lot to destroy a tech company. It just takes a better competitor. Just look at Yahoo, Nokia, Blackberry, MySpace, etc. They were the most powerful companies in their fields 10 or so years ago, but they are dying/dead now.\n\nSo technological change (computers and internet) has given individuals a lot more direct control over the means of production. Anarchy worked during times of hunting and gathering, but wasn't as useful afterwards. Feudalism worked during the agrarian economy, but didn't make sense in the era of factories. Communism might have worked during the industrial economy, but doesn't work in the modern internet driven service economy. We are starting to approach the era of automation.

That meant factories, farms, and other big expensive things. But in the modern service economy there is no centralized means of production. You don&amp;#39;t need a recording contract, you can just make music and post it to Sound Cloud. You don&amp;#39;t need a TV show, you can just make something and post it to Youtube. You don&amp;#39;t need a $200,000 taxi medallion to drive people around, you can just join something like Uber or Lyft. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jobs are now based on skills that people have, not on what expensive machines they own. There&amp;#39;s two obvious arguments agains this. First, there are still a ton of things in life where owning certain things (oil, gold, factories, etc.) does make you more powerful. That&amp;#39;s true, but it&amp;#39;s less so than at any other time in history and it&amp;#39;s moving in that direction everyday. Intellectual capital is the most important thing today, and no one can steal your brain from you. Next, you could argue that now companies like Sound Cloud, Youtube, Uber, and Lyft are becoming more powerful. That&amp;#39;s true, but it doesn&amp;#39;t take a lot to destroy a tech company. It just takes a better competitor. Just look at Yahoo, Nokia, Blackberry, MySpace, etc. They were the most powerful companies in their fields 10 or so years ago, but they are dying/dead now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So technological change (computers and internet) has given individuals a lot more direct control over the means of production. Anarchy worked during times of hunting and gathering, but wasn&amp;#39;t as useful afterwards. Feudalism worked during the agrarian economy, but didn&amp;#39;t make sense in the era of factories. Communism might have worked during the industrial economy, but doesn&amp;#39;t work in the modern internet driven service economy. We are starting to approach the era of automation.

Because of taught behaviours such as greed and racism, the bourgeoisie is responsible for the death of millions of people each and every day.

That's what facts are supposed to do, end debate by falsifying bad ideas.\n\n&gt;The reason for this is I feel I've become profoundly close minded in my views of world politics.

Hint, maybe you should LEARN from that, rather than ignoring it.\n\n&gt;I don't want to be close minded as it goes against everything I believe in.\n\nThen stop being closed minded and stop advocating for genocide.  Because that is what communism is.  It is genocide, terror, death on a colossal scale, one class of society murdering everyone that it doesn't like.  To quote marx himself, \" there is only one way in which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated, and that way is revolutionary terror.\"  \n\nAnd maybe, if it led to the utopia it promised, it would be worth it, but we saw a century of cracking eggs, and no omelet ever got made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So to summarize my &amp;#39;current&amp;#39; views: Workers around the world have been oppressed by the overruling bourgeoisie class for far too long. Because of taught behaviours such as greed and racism, the bourgeoisie is responsible for the death of millions of people each and every day. Peaceful efforts by the working population have resulted in no progress, leaving only a global violent revolt as the only solution. Until this happens, man kind will make little to no progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;yes, &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor\"&gt;progress.&lt;/a&gt;  so much &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward\"&gt;progress.&lt;/a&gt;.
