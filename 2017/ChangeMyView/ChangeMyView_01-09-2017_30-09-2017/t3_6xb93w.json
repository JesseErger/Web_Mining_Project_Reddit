It&amp;#39;s very often used as the only spectrum political viewpoints can exist on, rather than just one of god knows how many.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The left-right dichotomy exists more in the US, and there it is a product of the two party system. Blaming actions on either side is of course not good. However, both sides also do have characteristics which need to be recognized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;quot;extremist&amp;quot; is, in my opinion, just as unhelpful. Being far from the center doesn&amp;#39;t make them extreme, just makes them opposed to the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, and I know you didn&amp;#39;t mention this in the OP, the words &amp;quot;alt right&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;alt left&amp;quot; are unnecessary, and are largely attempts at an unnecessary relabeling. Especially alt right was a rebranding by the followers of the ideology itself, while alt left was one that was attempted forced on the far left. This might be why it didn&amp;#39;t catch on as much as alt right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general, people need to pay more attention to actual ideologies and positions, not just the left-right spectrum. The spectrum itself is not unhelpful, but people&amp;#39;s overreliance on it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dmfenfc", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/6xb93w/cmv_using_the_words_right_and_left_to_lump/dmfenfc/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1504308070.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1504279270.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6xb93w", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6xb93w", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dmg7erl", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "FSFlyingSnail", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dmfx2tr", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Thank you I will look into that.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you I will look into that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dmg7erl", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/6xb93w/cmv_using_the_words_right_and_left_to_lump/dmg7erl/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1504342096.0, "author_flair_text": "2\u2206", "created_utc": 1504313296.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dmfx2tr", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Iamboringtbh", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_6xb93w", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "One thing that I appreciate about British politics is that there are groups along the spectrum - though the middle party is much less popular nowadays.
