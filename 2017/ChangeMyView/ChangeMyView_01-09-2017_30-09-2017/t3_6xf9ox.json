Poor people have cars that don't work right, which is annoying. They break down all the time, the air con doesn't blow cold, there's a hole in the dash where someone stole the stereo. People who are doing OK have nice cars that are well maintained, reliable, and comfortable. \n\nBut what do really rich people have? Ferraris, Bugattis, Aston Martins. Those cars suck. They've got a zillion one-off, handmade components that have not been tested as thoroughly and are at the limits of engineering, so they break down all the time. The fuel consumption sucks; OK, you're rich so you don't care about the money, but you still have to stop at a gas station every hundred miles. Hardly glamorous. There's no space, the driving position is uncomfortable, and you don't get basic amenities that are standard on cars that cost 20 times less. \n\nOK, *theoretically* they go faster than a normal hatchback.

If pursuing them is too easy though, the happiness will be fleeting and hollow. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whereas for the poor, I think the basic heartfelt desire is to provide for ones family, and to see that your children are better off than you. If you feel frustrated in that desire, as many poor people do, then you&amp;#39;ll be miserable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is all theory now though, based in Lacanian psychology. The idea is that most happiness is subconscious, and often tied to desires we are not aware we have. What links all these subconscious desires is that they are essentially unattainable ... or rather, if they are obtained, the results are often catastrophic. Like if you spent years idealizing someone, and then they fall in love with you... the mismatch between the ideal and the reality can be ruinous. Why so many celebrities commit suicide and have other mental problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry that I&amp;#39;ve strayed so far from topic.
