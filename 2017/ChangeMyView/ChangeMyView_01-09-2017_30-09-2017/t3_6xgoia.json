As someone who has lived in multiple states and many very different cities, I&amp;#39;ve been surprised by how easy it is to find historical/cultural places even in tiny towns. I used to live in a town of 8,000 - a poor, blue collar, struggling community - there were historical markers and monuments all over town. We&amp;#39;re talking dozens of monuments that I just stumbled upon in a town you could drive all the way through in &amp;lt;2 min, and they were mostly unrelated to war/battles at all. The bigger cities I&amp;#39;ve lived in have had even more historical and cultural attractions. When I lived in the South, yes, there were plenty of Confederate monuments, etc., but those were FAR from dominant. My point is that - as it&amp;#39;s currently presented - it sounds like you might be indulging in some confirmation bias when you compare European cities to US cities. How are you concluding that US cities have so few monuments? Are you making an educated guess based on what you remember seeing or are you actively looking for all the historical places in any given city? I imagine it also depends on where you live and travel. It&amp;#39;s possible I&amp;#39;ve just gotten lucky with the places I&amp;#39;ve been. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dmfxb5y", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/6xgoia/cmv_american_cities_are_terribly_designed_and/dmfxb5y/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1504328735.0, "author_flair_text": "4\u2206", "created_utc": 1504299935.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 34, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6xgoia", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -5, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6xgoia", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 16, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6xgoia", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dmfx20z", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CHESTHAIR_OVERDRIVE", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dmfwxvz", "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I brought the New Jersey cities out because they're relatively obscure cities that honor local heroes.

Which is why the \"elite\" moved into the cities and flourised from there. While in US there were incredible natural resources still untapped in modern era. A rural life flourished there first. There are so many historical factors to answer this one, none of which is the \"cities\" fault.
