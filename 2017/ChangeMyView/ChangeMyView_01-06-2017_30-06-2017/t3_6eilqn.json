The feeling of \"wanting to live\" doesn't guarantee that right (or make it right) for us, or for any animal as it struggles in the jaws of another, or for an innocent child, or for an old man on his death bed scared to die, or for a murderer.

This is the source of our ability to be *rational* creatures with self-ownership instead of *irrational* creatures that \"can't do otherwise\" from what their feelings demand. This ability makes humans *vastly* superior to other animals, and makes humans more valuable *to us* than other animals are to us.
