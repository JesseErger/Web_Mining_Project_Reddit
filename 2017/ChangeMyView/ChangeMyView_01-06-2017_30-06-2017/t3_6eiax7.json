That would change the structure of this argument, because then &amp;quot;early voting&amp;quot; would just become voting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now with that being said, elections typically run for a long time; we&amp;#39;re talking years of campaigning for the candidates. The likelihood of some catastrophically detrimental detail emerging that tarnishes a candidate during early voting is pretty low. Usually, all the dirty laundry has already been aired before voting occurred, so there&amp;#39;s really not much more than can shift opinions at that point. &amp;quot;Early&amp;quot; favorites aren&amp;#39;t exactly early, because opinions are not going to dramatically shift in the few days of early voting leading up to the real voting day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dialdoj", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/6eiax7/cmv_early_voting_while_having_some_benefits_is/dialdoj/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1496301343.0, "author_flair_text": "1\u2206", "created_utc": 1496272543.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6eiax7", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6eiax7", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "diajn5w", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Agnos", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_diajkgn", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Name recognition, knowledge of who the candidates are, what they say.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Name recognition, knowledge of who the candidates are, what they say.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_diajn5w", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/6eiax7/cmv_early_voting_while_having_some_benefits_is/diajn5w/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1496299086.0, "author_flair_text": "2\u2206", "created_utc": 1496270286.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "diajkgn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_6eiax7", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_diajkgn", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/6eiax7/cmv_early_voting_while_having_some_benefits_is/diajkgn/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1496298991.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1496270191.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}]
