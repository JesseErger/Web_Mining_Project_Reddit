Also, as I said, in my country around 42% of an average person&amp;#39;s income goes towards taxes. So that extra $4 per hour means more of a headache for businesses and insignificantly more in your bank account. Now of course, you shouldn&amp;#39;t have to starve, but the way to tackle that is through less taxation and lower product costs (which are achieved by lowering operating costs). Rising the minimum wage just makes businesses more likely to threaten job cuts, thus jeopardizing those who rely on those jobs for income. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_diamc2f", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/6ei816/cmv_a_15hour_minimum_wage_is_a_disastrous/diamc2f/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1496302597.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1496273797.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 1, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -4, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6ei816", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 19, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6ei816", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -32, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6ei816", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 11, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6ei816", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -6, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6ei816", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 11, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6ei816", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6ei816", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6ei816", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "diayxsi", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RustyRook", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dias44y", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Sorry the_pondering_lad, your comment has been removed: \n\n&gt; Comment Rule 5\\. \"No low effort comments.

Does it cost more to feed a person, house, and provide all their living expenses, or to provide food stamps as a supplement?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_diaxlab", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/6ei816/cmv_a_15hour_minimum_wage_is_a_disastrous/diaxlab/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1496317698.0, "author_flair_text": "1\u2206", "created_utc": 1496288898.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 10, "name": "t1_dib6kig", "id": "dib6kig", "parent_id": "t1_diak5a0", "depth": 1, "children": ["dib6kig", "diaxv69", "dibdd63", "dib2sge", "dib5qhk"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "diak5a0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "broccolicat", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_6ei816", "score": 225, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I also know a lot of small business owners who agree with the wage increase (I think we're in the same province :)), and were already paying employees 15$+ an hour, because frankly, it's VERY difficult to live on minimum wage.

A lot of this is corporate mishaps and failures, not a reflection of the economy, with blunders much more akin to Blockbuster going down in the Netflix age (failure to adapt early on, etc).\n\nI know a lot of clothing stores in the states struggle because they fucked up their image and demographic. J Crew comes to mind. They're not under yet but they're hurting. Why?

Economics is often about trade-offs of opposing economic forces, so the question shouldn't be so much about \"disastrous proposition\" and should be more about what the trade-off is.\n\nIn general the trade-off you'd expect is that there should be fewer low-end jobs, but those that have them earn more. This trades off two outcomes. It moves some people up to a better quality of living such that they need less subsidization support elsewhere, and can spend and save more money elsewhere in the economy. Those are all good things. But, what happens to the ones who don't get jobs. Well, we either need programs for them (employment insurance, training, education, or perhaps welfare if necessary) or they just get worse off. So in principle, a higher minimum wage should come with a commitment to better programs to raise the outcomes for those who can't get those low paying jobs. \n\nThat sounds like it costs more money, but not necessarily. If the lower minimum salary meant that people in low-end jobs required other subsidization to survive, you are effectively providing welfare to the businesses and trapping people in low-end jobs. That is, the people are tied up working so (a) have less/no time for education or improved training as they try to get by, and (b) are maxed out on their labour hours and still don't have enough to get by so require subsidization. They are trapped by their employment, and the businesses benefit from that. They aren't paying fair market wages because their employees are, in effect, having some of their wages subsidizes by taxpayers via such programs. Without those programs, the people can't get by, can't work (or live) and the businesses lose their workers. A \"living wage\", in that sense, is the *real* minimum market value. Below that requires non-market help. So, by increasing minimum wage to *at least* the level where people don't require additional subsidization, you've now removed the taxpayer costs. Well, for the ones that keep their jobs at least. For the ones that don't, well, now those programs can be funded by the savings from subsidizing those left on the job. \n\nIf those numbers work out in a wash, it may seem like there is no benefit. But, now none of them are trapped. That is, those with the jobs are making enough of a living to get by, and those not working but in education and training are now *improving* their labour value as an investment in future earnings, which tends to pay off.\n\nOK, so what about empirical data. There's certainly [correlative evidence](http://www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org/brief/evidence-higher-minimum-wages-improve-economic-wellbeing) that higher minimum wages mean better economic status and quality of life, but that's at a macroscopic scale across nations. It could be that those with better economies implement higher minimum wages. Really we want to see what happens more in a given nation when you raise or lower minimum wage and what happens as a result.\n\nSince you are likely Canadian and from Ontario, since they just announced raising the minimum wage to $15, let's look at some Canadian studies. Certainly the [Frasier Institute doesn't like it](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/raising-the-minimum-wage-misguided-policy-unintended-consequences.pdf), which is no surprise. But their predictions also completely failed according to the [Canadian Center for Policy Alternatives](https://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/BC%20Office/2015/04/CCPA-BC-Case-for-Incr-Minimum-Wage_0.pdf). Fraser Institute predicted a 16% job lose in teens for 2011 hike in B.C. but it was only 1.6% loss, and a simultaneous 1.1% increase in post-secondary school. If you read through the reports, you see many of these trade-offs. \n\nBut, most importantly, you don't see disaster. The predictions of disaster just never happen. These changes do tend to have the *binary* effects predicted: some greater unemployment at the low end and greater training, but it tend to have rippling effect up the wages a little and people tend to get better options in the long run.\n\nBut, that depends on the *amount* of increase. For small increases there seems to be a little improvement overall, but that doesn't say what size it should be. At least a living wage makes sense, but it also seems to matter as a percentage of average wage. If pushed to high too fast, that affects a lot more people and even up into the more educated categories, and reduces the return on investment for education and skills training.\n\nSo I'd have to say the most likely scenario is a shift with some negative impacts in low-end employment, but an overall economic trend of more educated and trained people with better opportunities. There may be a modest increase in low-end prices as well, shifting the cost burden from taxes to consumer goods and manufacturing costs.\n\nIt will be a little *different*, but not disastrous. Probably a net positive, but not necessarily. At least no jurisdiction that has done this seems to show disaster. Some negatives and some positives, yes.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all you need a commitment to &lt;em&gt;empirical&lt;/em&gt; evidence, not just one idea that you have in your head about how things work. Economics is often about trade-offs of opposing economic forces, so the question shouldn&amp;#39;t be so much about &amp;quot;disastrous proposition&amp;quot; and should be more about what the trade-off is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general the trade-off you&amp;#39;d expect is that there should be fewer low-end jobs, but those that have them earn more. This trades off two outcomes. It moves some people up to a better quality of living such that they need less subsidization support elsewhere, and can spend and save more money elsewhere in the economy. Those are all good things. But, what happens to the ones who don&amp;#39;t get jobs. Well, we either need programs for them (employment insurance, training, education, or perhaps welfare if necessary) or they just get worse off. So in principle, a higher minimum wage should come with a commitment to better programs to raise the outcomes for those who can&amp;#39;t get those low paying jobs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That sounds like it costs more money, but not necessarily. If the lower minimum salary meant that people in low-end jobs required other subsidization to survive, you are effectively providing welfare to the businesses and trapping people in low-end jobs. That is, the people are tied up working so (a) have less/no time for education or improved training as they try to get by, and (b) are maxed out on their labour hours and still don&amp;#39;t have enough to get by so require subsidization. They are trapped by their employment, and the businesses benefit from that. They aren&amp;#39;t paying fair market wages because their employees are, in effect, having some of their wages subsidizes by taxpayers via such programs. Without those programs, the people can&amp;#39;t get by, can&amp;#39;t work (or live) and the businesses lose their workers. A &amp;quot;living wage&amp;quot;, in that sense, is the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; minimum market value. Below that requires non-market help. So, by increasing minimum wage to &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; the level where people don&amp;#39;t require additional subsidization, you&amp;#39;ve now removed the taxpayer costs. Well, for the ones that keep their jobs at least. For the ones that don&amp;#39;t, well, now those programs can be funded by the savings from subsidizing those left on the job. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If those numbers work out in a wash, it may seem like there is no benefit. But, now none of them are trapped. That is, those with the jobs are making enough of a living to get by, and those not working but in education and training are now &lt;em&gt;improving&lt;/em&gt; their labour value as an investment in future earnings, which tends to pay off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OK, so what about empirical data. There&amp;#39;s certainly &lt;a href=\"http://www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org/brief/evidence-higher-minimum-wages-improve-economic-wellbeing\"&gt;correlative evidence&lt;/a&gt; that higher minimum wages mean better economic status and quality of life, but that&amp;#39;s at a macroscopic scale across nations. It could be that those with better economies implement higher minimum wages. Really we want to see what happens more in a given nation when you raise or lower minimum wage and what happens as a result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since you are likely Canadian and from Ontario, since they just announced raising the minimum wage to $15, let&amp;#39;s look at some Canadian studies. Certainly the &lt;a href=\"https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/raising-the-minimum-wage-misguided-policy-unintended-consequences.pdf\"&gt;Frasier Institute doesn&amp;#39;t like it&lt;/a&gt;, which is no surprise. But their predictions also completely failed according to the &lt;a href=\"https://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/BC%20Office/2015/04/CCPA-BC-Case-for-Incr-Minimum-Wage_0.pdf\"&gt;Canadian Center for Policy Alternatives&lt;/a&gt;. Fraser Institute predicted a 16% job lose in teens for 2011 hike in B.C. but it was only 1.6% loss, and a simultaneous 1.1% increase in post-secondary school. If you read through the reports, you see many of these trade-offs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, most importantly, you don&amp;#39;t see disaster. The predictions of disaster just never happen. These changes do tend to have the &lt;em&gt;binary&lt;/em&gt; effects predicted: some greater unemployment at the low end and greater training, but it tend to have rippling effect up the wages a little and people tend to get better options in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, that depends on the &lt;em&gt;amount&lt;/em&gt; of increase. For small increases there seems to be a little improvement overall, but that doesn&amp;#39;t say what size it should be. At least a living wage makes sense, but it also seems to matter as a percentage of average wage. If pushed to high too fast, that affects a lot more people and even up into the more educated categories, and reduces the return on investment for education and skills training.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;d have to say the most likely scenario is a shift with some negative impacts in low-end employment, but an overall economic trend of more educated and trained people with better opportunities. There may be a modest increase in low-end prices as well, shifting the cost burden from taxes to consumer goods and manufacturing costs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will be a little &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;, but not disastrous. Probably a net positive, but not necessarily. At least no jurisdiction that has done this seems to show disaster.

A higher minimum wage might speed up the timetable a bit. But: capitalism creates new jobs in response to automation. Historically, we have been good at automating making stuff but not at services (the productivity of a barber is equal to 200 years ago, give or take), so now we need few people to make lots of stuff but we still need people to provide services. The result of this is that people consume more services, not that nobody has jobs. As we begin to automate some services, demand increases for hard-to-automate services as easy-to-automate services get cheap. Think boutique coffee shops where you have really nice interactions with the baristas: that's service sector work that requires a human. In this context, the threat posed by automation isn't that nobody has jobs. It's how it displaces specific people during transition periods, which (in my mind) is the job of the welfare state to smooth out. A higher minimum wage may marginally speed up transitions from human to automatic in some areas, but it doesn't fundamentally alter the dynamics.\n\n- **Union decline perspective**: Unions (at least in the US) used to be much stronger which boosted wages. Right now, unions are weak which leads to low wages. A higher minimum wage can be considered a partial substitute for a highly unionized workforce.\n\n- **Returns to capital perspective**: Western economies are flush with wealth, and wealth has good returns relative to economic growth. Picketty argues that this leads to a concentration of wealth and huge inequality. In this context, a higher minimum wage can be seen as a partial (but very incomplete) response to a high-inequality system. It doesn't fix the high rate of return to capital relative to growth, but it does say: \"we're no longer in the high-growth postwar period and we need to take steps to deal with that reality\".\n\n- **Production cost of goods perspective**: I'm just speculating here but I can't imagine that most of the cost of your car, house, etc. is comprised of minimum wage labor in the country you live in. Let's say a product costs 1 dollar and 10 cents of that is below $15/hr labor. Then if you assume that $15 is double the current wage, you would pay $1.10 instead of $1 for the product. Remember that lots of people are going from like $12 to $15, in which case the good would go from $1 to $1.025. Not a massive change. You can find lots of reports about Walmart saying if they paid everyone $15 the average shopper would only pay a few cents per trip.\n\n- **The ethical perspective**: What's the purpose of enduring the negatives of capitalism\u2014lots of work, stressful competition, industries leaving and new ones popping up where you don't have the skills, boom and bust cycles\u2014if we're not going to share the benefits (wealth, innovation, education, technology) with everyone?

You&amp;#39;re correct that it does drive inflation, but not significantly so and not at all if the rate of growth in the minimum wage is less than worker productivity growth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dib7jbx", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/6ei816/cmv_a_15hour_minimum_wage_is_a_disastrous/dib7jbx/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1496340650.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1496311850.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 6, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6ei816", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "diaujsy", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DeltaBot", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_6ei816", "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "/u/alexmrb (OP) has awarded 1 delta in this post.\n\nAll comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed [**here**](/r/DeltaLog/comments/6ejw1t), in /r/DeltaLog.\n\nPlease note that a change of view [doesn't necessarily mean a reversal](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_a_.27view.27.3F), or that the conversation has ended.\n\n^[Delta\u00a0System\u00a0Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "points", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/alexmrb\"&gt;/u/alexmrb&lt;/a&gt; (OP) has awarded 1 delta in this post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed &lt;a href=\"/r/DeltaLog/comments/6ejw1t\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"/r/DeltaLog\"&gt;/r/DeltaLog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please note that a change of view &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_a_.27view.27.3F\"&gt;doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean a reversal&lt;/a&gt;, or that the conversation has ended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem\"&gt;Delta\u00a0System\u00a0Explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;|&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards\"&gt;Deltaboards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_diaujsy", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/6ei816/cmv_a_15hour_minimum_wage_is_a_disastrous/diaujsy/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1496313467.0, "author_flair_text": "\u221e\u2206", "created_utc": 1496284667.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": "moderator"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_6ei816", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "diayycg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DontHateDefenestrate", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_6ei816", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "The idea that rising wages will lead to layoffs and/or reduced hiring relies on the assumption that what workers are being paid is already anything close to the maximum that a business would be willing to pay them to get that job done.\n\nRecall that the difference between what a buyer pays for something and the most that that buyer *would have paid for it* is called \"gain from trade\".

The increase in automation (both the service and the production that goes into providing what is needed to serve) means that we are going to be able to produce things with the only ongoing cost being electricity (because even repairs can be automated). So lets say a 6-pack of beer at the store; the simple costs associated with that are the brewing, can creation, and canning of it. Right now lets say you have 1 employee for each of those jobs ($5), and the materials you need for those jobs ($5). Meaning a single 6-pack costs $10 dollars to produce. When you put in full automation the price falls to the cost of electricity (which if generated from your own solar panels, also built by bots, is free. If not it is still vastly cheaper than paying for human labor either in the cost of materials or in their actual labor cost). \n\nSo the idea that product prices will rise, even if the base pay increases, is a false one. IF prices rise it will be due to businesses seeking to attain greater surplus, not due to cost (greed in other words).\n\nSecondly the youth unemployment and automation trends are actually a good thing in my view. Employment is a means to an end and automation creates a different possibility for that end by making it possible for everything one might need to be produced, the be produced without human labor. A $15 minimum wage may push large businesses into adopting greater automation (which will decrease costs as time goes on, as opposed to the increasing costs associated with human labor) which just moves humanity closer to full automation.\n\nWill the transition be rough? Probably, which is why many of the people I listen to advocate for different versions of Universal Basic Income (not that I agree with them, imo UBI is a terrible idea).

", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I personally think there is an assumption here that the acceleration of youth unemployment and automation are bad and that there will be price product increases due to the increase in minimum wage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing I want to point out is the the price of technology gets rapidly cheaper, in spite of how slowly things go into public domain. The increase in automation (both the service and the production that goes into providing what is needed to serve) means that we are going to be able to produce things with the only ongoing cost being electricity (because even repairs can be automated). So lets say a 6-pack of beer at the store; the simple costs associated with that are the brewing, can creation, and canning of it. Right now lets say you have 1 employee for each of those jobs ($5), and the materials you need for those jobs ($5). Meaning a single 6-pack costs $10 dollars to produce. When you put in full automation the price falls to the cost of electricity (which if generated from your own solar panels, also built by bots, is free. If not it is still vastly cheaper than paying for human labor either in the cost of materials or in their actual labor cost). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the idea that product prices will rise, even if the base pay increases, is a false one. IF prices rise it will be due to businesses seeking to attain greater surplus, not due to cost (greed in other words).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly the youth unemployment and automation trends are actually a good thing in my view. Employment is a means to an end and automation creates a different possibility for that end by making it possible for everything one might need to be produced, the be produced without human labor. A $15 minimum wage may push large businesses into adopting greater automation (which will decrease costs as time goes on, as opposed to the increasing costs associated with human labor) which just moves humanity closer to full automation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will the transition be rough? Probably, which is why many of the people I listen to advocate for different versions of Universal Basic Income (not that I agree with them, imo UBI is a terrible idea). However as the industrial revolution provided a complete transition of quality of life, so to would automation; and there are other solutions to the problem of youth unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last thing I wanted to point out is that raising the minimum wage extends the period of time between depressions.

The people who are concerned with minimum wage are in the lowest tax bracket. I don't know where you live but no country in the world taxes 50% of income for the lowest tax bracket. The highest is Netherlands at a theoretical 36% but then this is subject to deductibles so the effective tax rate is closer to 20-25%, if even that. Most countries scale their tax rate and so most people concerned with minimum wage have an almost non existant taxation. Your average effective tax rate my be close to 50%, but this figure includes ALL income earners. The fact of the matter is that raising the minimum wage does put more money into people's pockets, and it puts more money into people's pockets that spend a significant portion of their money locally, and that tend to spend most of their money rather than save it. Despite what many want to believe when they praise the debunked top down approach consisting of infusing cash at the top (where people save and spend significant cash in non-local markets), the best way to infuse capital into the local economy indirectly is to give it to the people at the bottom of it.\n\nThe second erroneous concept is that raising the minimum wage would impact prices. Prices would shoot up if ALL wages were raised, as overall spending power would rise. However the fact of the matter is that only a very small portion of people are even affected by minimum wage, and that very small portion would not make prices skyrocket by increasing their purchasing power.\n\nThe main problem I have with your approach is that you talk a lot about the ills of raising minimum wage but little about the ills of not providing people with a living wage.

The people who are concerned with minimum wage are in the lowest tax bracket. I don&amp;#39;t know where you live but no country in the world taxes 50% of income for the lowest tax bracket. The highest is Netherlands at a theoretical 36% but then this is subject to deductibles so the effective tax rate is closer to 20-25%, if even that. Most countries scale their tax rate and so most people concerned with minimum wage have an almost non existant taxation. Your average effective tax rate my be close to 50%, but this figure includes ALL income earners. The fact of the matter is that raising the minimum wage does put more money into people&amp;#39;s pockets, and it puts more money into people&amp;#39;s pockets that spend a significant portion of their money locally, and that tend to spend most of their money rather than save it. Despite what many want to believe when they praise the debunked top down approach consisting of infusing cash at the top (where people save and spend significant cash in non-local markets), the best way to infuse capital into the local economy indirectly is to give it to the people at the bottom of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second erroneous concept is that raising the minimum wage would impact prices. Prices would shoot up if ALL wages were raised, as overall spending power would rise. However the fact of the matter is that only a very small portion of people are even affected by minimum wage, and that very small portion would not make prices skyrocket by increasing their purchasing power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main problem I have with your approach is that you talk a lot about the ills of raising minimum wage but little about the ills of not providing people with a living wage. If people don&amp;#39;t make a living wage, then often there are societal costs as people don&amp;#39;t have enough money to survive.
