Just checked this thread and saw your reply.\n\nSo regarding meditation you'll find I'm almost painfully opinionated. Mainly I feel like a lot of the advice and circlejerking on reddit is deeply misguided and likely does more harm than good. For starters I'd strongly advise you to steer away from mindfulness and vipassana Buddhism, or any kind of dogmatic practice of that kind really. \n\nThe point of meditation for me is to understand the connections between our cognitive 'monkey' mind, our emotions, and our 'somatic' mind -- how the sensations in our body connect to emotional feels and cognitive thoughts. Is it really possible to dispel all emotions at all? I'd say no, and also have to wonder whether this is a constructive goal for meditation whatsoever. \n\nSo what I'm advocating is using the breath as a tool to quiet the monkey mind and feel those deeper connections I'm referring to. The truth is that in many cases our emotional state directly affects our thought process as much as the reverse, thoughts affecting emotions. \n\nOf course meditation is certainly not for every one, I feel like there can be other ways to achieve similar states that can be helpful if there's too much dogmatic baggage attached to the meditation practice (I'm looking at you, /r/meditation). Feel free to completely disregard my advice but whatever path you take I hope it leads you to that place of serenity that allows us a quick glimpse of things as they really are.

Just checked this thread and saw your reply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So regarding meditation you&amp;#39;ll find I&amp;#39;m almost painfully opinionated. Mainly I feel like a lot of the advice and circlejerking on reddit is deeply misguided and likely does more harm than good. For starters I&amp;#39;d strongly advise you to steer away from mindfulness and vipassana Buddhism, or any kind of dogmatic practice of that kind really. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point of meditation for me is to understand the connections between our cognitive &amp;#39;monkey&amp;#39; mind, our emotions, and our &amp;#39;somatic&amp;#39; mind -- how the sensations in our body connect to emotional feels and cognitive thoughts. Is it really possible to dispel all emotions at all? I&amp;#39;d say no, and also have to wonder whether this is a constructive goal for meditation whatsoever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what I&amp;#39;m advocating is using the breath as a tool to quiet the monkey mind and feel those deeper connections I&amp;#39;m referring to. The truth is that in many cases our emotional state directly affects our thought process as much as the reverse, thoughts affecting emotions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course meditation is certainly not for every one, I feel like there can be other ways to achieve similar states that can be helpful if there&amp;#39;s too much dogmatic baggage attached to the meditation practice (I&amp;#39;m looking at you, &lt;a href=\"/r/meditation\"&gt;/r/meditation&lt;/a&gt;). Feel free to completely disregard my advice but whatever path you take I hope it leads you to that place of serenity that allows us a quick glimpse of things as they really are. Not the &amp;#39;reality&amp;#39; that most of reddit, and the sort of fundamentalist materialism that is increasingly regarded as wisdom in modern society, holds so dear. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "InsightfulQuestions", "name": "t1_dc0elr6", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/InsightfulQuestions/comments/5lvr7l/how_can_i_find_and_face_my_fears/dc0elr6/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483605243.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483576443.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/InsightfulQuestions", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc0cvhm", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jafeelz", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dbzdbqi", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Yeah but I feel even during meditation there's something behind the curtain even when I try to dispel all emotions ", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah but I feel even during meditation there&amp;#39;s something behind the curtain even when I try to dispel all emotions &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "InsightfulQuestions", "name": "t1_dc0cvhm", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/InsightfulQuestions/comments/5lvr7l/how_can_i_find_and_face_my_fears/dc0cvhm/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483603036.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483574236.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/InsightfulQuestions", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbzdbqi", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "viborg", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5lvr7l", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Have you tried meditation?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you tried meditation?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "InsightfulQuestions", "name": "t1_dbzdbqi", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/InsightfulQuestions/comments/5lvr7l/how_can_i_find_and_face_my_fears/dbzdbqi/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483553075.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483524275.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/InsightfulQuestions", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2smsq", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lvr7l", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc14i22", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "kazarnowicz", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5lvr7l", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "If I interpret your question correctly, you're looking to find things in the two rightmost panes  of [Johari Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window) (blind spot, unknown), especially those regarding fear?\n\nI don't know how to help you with the \"unknown\" pane, but the \"blind spot\" is often something that is most clearly seen by people who don't know you.
