If any of these comments are snooty, I posit that it's yours: you are, after all, deriding someone for their perceived lack of sense or perspective or maturity, right? And derision is the standard defensive tactic of the true snoot when his or her sensibilities are questioned by someone who does not share those sensibilities, since the snootiest of sensibilities maintain themselves precisely by evading explanation and analysis, i.e. snooty tastes are only snooty because others do not understand them; there's sort of a \"the grown-ups are talking now\" vibe to it. This is what makes the snoot feel special, that they are not simply *different* from some imagined crowd but *smarter* than it, which smartness somehow equates un-problematically with *better*. This eagerness to jump from different to smarter to better would seem to suggest the workings of a snooty superiority complex, but I hypothesize that this is only camouflage for what is really an *inferiority* complex, one that views the explanation of that which makes the snoot feel different/smarter/better (i.e. his or her \"taste\") not simply as an *explanation* but as an *attack*, which perceived threat I think\u2014and, again, this is merely a hypothesis, n.b.\u2014has something to do with an exaggerated fear of (mental) penetration. Meaning that the snoot uses his or her snootiness as a sort of corbomite maneuver that denies the non-snoot crowd access to his, the snoot's, personal identity and to deride (i.e. punish) that crowd for attempting to get it; and why would anyone with a strong sense of personal identity need to execute such a maneuver? (And this may at least partly explain certain snoots' interest in dark/nihilistic/morbid humor, because it jibes with the OP's suggestion that some people's interest in such humor is an attempt to look tough/\"macho\"\u2014that is, unaffected by the world's tragedies/evils/injustices and indifferent to those who directly experience and suffer from them.) But anyway, I saw no such attitude in this thread until I read down to your comment, so I'm thinking that any negativity here is projected.\n\nAlso, I'm gonna have to differ with your claim that \"humor is subjective,\" most obviously because jokes whose humor is truly subjective in that they are funny only in the joker's head are, by definition, not funny. Funny jokes are, by definition, jokes that more than one person finds funny, meaning that the humor (like the culture and sub-culture of which said humor's a part) is really intersubjective (which is distinct both from \"objective\" and \"subjective,\" at least insofar as that latter term's used as a term of abuse and/or a thought-ending platitude by folks who'd prefer, for various reasons (not all of which are unflattering), not to reason with others at all). See, to me it seems that when someone labels X or Y or Z as \"subjective,\" that labeller thinks he's/she's being humble and perhaps inspiring others to be humble. Which would be a decent thing to do, of course. But in practice I find it, for lack of a better term, oppressive: it *does* after all, discourage people from sharing their \"subjective\" views or feelings. Plus, it does this weird thing whereby folks' subjective views/feelings are simultaneously destroyed and rendered meaningless (e.g. \"You think John Coltrane's better than Nickelback? That's just your opinion!\") *and* made totally impervious to outside input (e.g. \"Well, I like Nickelback more, and you can't prove me wrong!\"), neither of which is really mature or reasonable because each precludes the kind of dialogue in which people can challenge and maybe also enrich each other.
