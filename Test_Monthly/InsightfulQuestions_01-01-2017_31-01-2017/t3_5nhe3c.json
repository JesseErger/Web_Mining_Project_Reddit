I don't think this implies subjectivity, though, but a third category in between the two: intersubjectivity. \n\nThe classic example of something that's intersubjective is the value of money. A piece of paper or plastic is, literally, pretty much worthless; they take on value because we all *agree* that they do. The value is not an \"objective\" physical property of the paper or magnetic strip. But it's also not just my subjective opinion that my cashola has value.\n\nAnother classic example is a game, e.g. baseball. When the batter hits a homer, he does so according to rules that are neither purely objective nor purely subjective. A home run wouldn't exist if there weren't people who agree on what a home run *is*, so it's not a mind-independent feature of the universe (which is what we normally think of when we think of objectivity). Note that the ball *does* have an objective position and velocity relative to the ballpark, and that the bat whacked it with objective force and speed, but that these objective facts don't equal a home run. But imagine some weirdo telling you that, even though the ball flew clear out of the park, it was \"just your subjective opinion\" that that batter hit a home run because you can't prove that the home run \"objectively\" exists, since the facts just don't add up; that person's mistaken. Not about the rules themselves, but about the nature of the rules, i.e. what makes them valid.\n\nLots of stuff works this way, but not all stuff does, obviously. Gravity applies whether we agree on it or not, and it's 99.999% likely that climate change is real and human-caused, even if large numbers of Americans don't think so. So it's not like intersubjectivity implies relativism or nihilism or anything, but neither does it imply a rigid absolutism, since rules can change over time, and different games use different sets of rules that are all valid within the game. (In the context of art, this could mean that a string quartet should be held to different rules than a black metal album or an experimental novel.)\n\nBut this is what I think largely constitutes the value of an artwork. We assign lots of qualities to artworks that are intersubjective, neither *objective* properties of the work nor *subjective* perceptions that are invalid outside of one's head. There are objective features of a work that are worth talking about, like color palette or tempo changes or narrative distance, and there are also subjective responses that are worth talking about, like how *Infinite Jest* helped you through depression or how The Clash makes you want to stand up for your rights, but these are in addition to the intersubjective stuff.\n\nI go on at such length because I have zero patience for people who say art is strictly subjective, an attitude that tends to relegate art to a position that's basically worthless. Since if no one's opinion carries any weight outside their own head, then art itself carries no weight. And it's no coincidence that a lot of people in the \"merely subjective\" camp know little about art, since participating in the intersubjective stuff requires close attention for which few people have the patience, and at least some knowledge of not-very-fun stuff like art history, theory, etc.; basically, they don't like talking about their experience of art because they don't know how (and feel stupid when others have cogent or insightful things to say, especially when those things challenge their opinion). So it feeds back on itself: because we undervalue art we don't spend much time trying to understand it, and because we don't understand it very well we insist that evaluation is merely subjective, and because evaluation is merely subjective it's not usually worthwhile to discuss, and since we don't usually talk about it we don't improve our ability to analyze/interpret/critique, and since we don't use these skills very much we don't understand art very well, and because we don't understand art very well we insist that evaluation is merely subjective...and so on.\n\n", "edited": 1486333329.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. It&amp;#39;s certainly possible for one artwork to be more complex or unique or subtle or deep than another work, but equating these with value judgments like good or bad is where strict objectivity ends.
