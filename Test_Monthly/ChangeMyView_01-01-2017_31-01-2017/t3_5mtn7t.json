I was home schooled from the 4th grade until my freshman year of high school. I will address your concerns point by point but I may skip a few because several of your points can be addressed at once.\n\n1: (curriculum)  The work is generally far more rigorous than in public school. Once I reached 7th grade I was required to take standardized tests at the Jr HS in my district along with everyone else (public students). I CRUSHED those tests. They were absurdly easy. Am I some super smart kid? Nah, I'm average. I was just two/three years ahead. Every other home schooled kid I knew in my area reported the same thing. Oh yeah, home schooled kids have social groups, sorts teams etc. You are only isolated if you want to be.\n\n\n2: \"When your parents are the ones grading your work and making due dates, they might be a lot more forgiving than a real teacher. \"\n\nIts the opposite actually. Parents who home school do so because they want their kids to get the best possible education. In my experience they are much harder on their kids than any teacher is and obviously they have a VERY good idea of how their kids are doing in school. Think about it, 1 on 1 instruction, you can go over a subject as many times as you need to understand it because your not rushed by a class full of peers. And on the flip side you can advance as quickly as you like, there is no one to hold you back.\n\n3:\"I know there are outliers whose parents may home school them because they want to make it more challenging, but that's the outlier.\" \n\nProbably the most absurd claim I've ever heard. Please back that up with any kind of evidence.\n\n4: \"You may also get to concentrate on subjects you do well in\" \n\nOh noes, you might get to master subjects you have a talent for. How is this a bad thing? \"\n\n5: \"Parents may not be well enough educated in subjects in order to be good teachers.\"\n\nThis is a very common concern. Generally made by two types of people. First type is the person who doesn't have an education background or experience in the education system. These people are well meaning and in their defense it sounds like a good argument on the surface. The second are public education shills looking for any reason to discredit public school alternatives. \n\nThe reality is that you really dont need to be a professional teacher to teach you own child. The challenges faced by a professional teacher are non existent in a home school setting. You have a handful of students, your kids. You know them, their strengths and weaknesses, how they learn, what interests them, what doesn't. You dont have to worry about bullying at school, scheduling or ditching classes. There are home school organizations with advisers you can call/email for advice on hard subjects, help grading papers, really any issue you can think of. \n\n6: \"Many parents may choose to teach their kids incorrect things, like creationism.\"\n\nPersonally I think this is your only valid concern. I was raised in a very conservative christian home and I was taught with an absurd young earth creationist curriculum. Of course the irony is that I was so well educated that I not only aced the standardized tests in public school (I had to know the actual science) but I was able to easily debunk the religious indoctrination. Keep in mind I would have been (and was) force fed those ideas anyway.\n\n7: \"I think that a lack of social skills might develop. \" \n\nBecause kids in public school dont have social issues? There may be some confirmation bias at work here. Just look at public schools, bullying, shootings, gangs etc. If anything the instances of poor social development are more prevalent in the general population.\n\n\"Many people stereotype homeschooled kids as \"weird\" \n\nImagine being around a group of JR high kids when your in high school. They would seem immature to you and you would seem odd to them. But no one would really notice because its expected, your several years older after all. Well thats how homeschooled kids are, except they are the same age as the immature JR HS kids, it makes them (the home schoolers) stand out and seem weird. In reality they spend more time among adults so they seem more mature and they are generally several years ahead intellectually. By the time home schooled kids reach adulthood they are MUCH harder to pick out. Of course some people are weird and when you meet a weirdo who happened to be home schooled he/she is going to stand out.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former home schooled student here.

How is this a bad thing? &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5: &amp;quot;Parents may not be well enough educated in subjects in order to be good teachers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a very common concern. Generally made by two types of people. First type is the person who doesn&amp;#39;t have an education background or experience in the education system. These people are well meaning and in their defense it sounds like a good argument on the surface. The second are public education shills looking for any reason to discredit public school alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reality is that you really dont need to be a professional teacher to teach you own child. The challenges faced by a professional teacher are non existent in a home school setting. You have a handful of students, your kids. You know them, their strengths and weaknesses, how they learn, what interests them, what doesn&amp;#39;t. You dont have to worry about bullying at school, scheduling or ditching classes. There are home school organizations with advisers you can call/email for advice on hard subjects, help grading papers, really any issue you can think of. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6: &amp;quot;Many parents may choose to teach their kids incorrect things, like creationism.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally I think this is your only valid concern. I was raised in a very conservative christian home and I was taught with an absurd young earth creationist curriculum. Of course the irony is that I was so well educated that I not only aced the standardized tests in public school (I had to know the actual science) but I was able to easily debunk the religious indoctrination. Keep in mind I would have been (and was) force fed those ideas anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7: &amp;quot;I think that a lack of social skills might develop. &amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because kids in public school dont have social issues? There may be some confirmation bias at work here. Just look at public schools, bullying, shootings, gangs etc. If anything the instances of poor social development are more prevalent in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Many people stereotype homeschooled kids as &amp;quot;weird&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine being around a group of JR high kids when your in high school. They would seem immature to you and you would seem odd to them. But no one would really notice because its expected, your several years older after all. Well thats how homeschooled kids are, except they are the same age as the immature JR HS kids, it makes them (the home schoolers) stand out and seem weird. In reality they spend more time among adults so they seem more mature and they are generally several years ahead intellectually. By the time home schooled kids reach adulthood they are MUCH harder to pick out. Of course some people are weird and when you meet a weirdo who happened to be home schooled he/she is going to stand out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc6ghms", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5mtn7t/cmv_homeschooling_isnt_a_good_idea_for_most/dc6ghms/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483952404.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483923604.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 6, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mtn7t", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mtn7t", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 4, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mtn7t", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc6byrb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jumpup", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc6ab96", "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "nope, its the effect of the no kid left behind and other such initiatives, while the intent is good the side effects are slowing down education.  \n\na but here the thing most people already are seeing as its something we teach children,  when you get into the really advanced topics it takes more effort for a parent, but since they plan the lesson course they can study ahead, and since most of grade school isn't needed for revision that means they have several years to better quaint themselves with the lesson material.\n\nand again its quite easy to learn online these days, especially if you already have a good lesson plan for what you need to know.\n\nthey might be, but they would also be alarmed that there is such a thing as a [creationist museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_Museum)  hell some schools are alarmed that religion is taught\n\nbeing able to sit still is a lot easier if you don't have distracting  classmates,  and were there no other kids in your neighborhood growing up?

They can't be perfect. The frequency of bullying in school is something you cannot predict. You cannot predict how likely your child is to end up bullied, abused, etc.. Regardless of whether it's the school's fault, and regardless of how blamable the bullying is or isn't on the school, the fact of the matter is that homeschooling removes that risk.\n\nAlso, further points: what if your school is underfunded? What if you disagree with certain educational policies? What if you have a lot of concern for your child, too much so to allow them to go to the school where you will not be able to monitor them and help them? What if you were someone who witnessed bullying in school when you were a child, or witnessed things you didn't like in adolescent/child culture? What if you disagree with how a lot of adolescents/children turn out and want to tailor your child's educational path and lifestyle to counterbalance that?\n\nAnd one other really good point I forgot to mention: when you are homeschooling, you are essentially fusing tutoring into your education. Tutoring is expensive and time-consuming when your child isn't being homeschooled (i.e. transport, finding a tutor, paying them etc.). If the parent or guardian or nanny knows the material well (which should not be hard for the elementary school level), then I am quite sure the child is better off homeschooled (given one-on-one attention and not in an attention marketplace) than in a classroom.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are these creationist schools accredited or even slightly common?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_and_evolution_in_public_education_in_the_United_States#Development_by_state\"&gt;The fact that this list is this long should tell you that it is not as open-and-shut as it should be.&lt;/a&gt; If you don&amp;#39;t live in any of those states then that&amp;#39;s fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think it is the responsibility of the school to handle bullies, and that more drastic action may need to be taken, but I don&amp;#39;t think that means homeschooling is usually the better option.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s only so much schools can do to handle bullies. They can&amp;#39;t be perfect. The frequency of bullying in school is something you cannot predict. You cannot predict how likely your child is to end up bullied, abused, etc.. Regardless of whether it&amp;#39;s the school&amp;#39;s fault, and regardless of how blamable the bullying is or isn&amp;#39;t on the school, the fact of the matter is that homeschooling removes that risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, further points: what if your school is underfunded? What if you disagree with certain educational policies?
