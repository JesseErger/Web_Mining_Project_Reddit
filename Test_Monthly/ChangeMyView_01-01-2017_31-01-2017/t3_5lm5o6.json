We were receiving trucks full of merchandise on a daily basis, and the night crew was completely unable to keep up with the constant influx which led to our entire downstairs warehouse being completely filled with pallets of boxes that couldn&amp;#39;t be located through our computer system. The result of all this was that lines of cars would often wrap around the block as I was literally climbing over boxes trying to find an item that was supposed to be &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt; downstairs while a crowd of people waiting on their orders stood near the door complaining about how slow the service was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Combine that with having to constantly run up and downstairs to retrieve layaways, and I left multiple times on or after Black Friday barely able to walk due to giant blisters on the soles of my feet. Meanwhile, managers would be getting upset that the bike racks on the floor were nearly empty, as if I would ever have time to build anything while trying to manage a neverending list of incoming orders. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I certainly wouldn&amp;#39;t claim to have the hardest job in the world or anything, but that was a pretty hellish couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbwyxin", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lm5o6/cmv_retail_work_is_not_bad_enough_to_warrant_the/dbwyxin/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483417973.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483389173.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbwr28y", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "chasingstatues", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5lm5o6", "score": 27, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Some of your points are completely valid, but there are a couple I think are way off-base.

Stocking involved a good deal of physical labor. Boxes filled with apples or bottles of olive oil are *heavy*. We had to break down pallettes, make stacks, use handtrucks to wheel the stacks, pull uboats around, etc. We had to push carts from the parking lot across the street and up a twisted ramp to our store in the summer heat, or rain, or snow.

Other professions can be paid holidays without even working. So I don't think the extra pay is really a consolation.\n\n2. It doesn't change the fact that these holiday times are often blackout days, or otherwise non-optional.\n\n3. Some people value spending time with extended family over whatever extra money there is. At one of my old jobs, the Thanksgiving shift started 5PM on Thanksgiving for everyone that worked there. Which basically means no Thanksgiving time for anyone. Then it went until midnight for some or 5AM the next day for others. Those that stayed until midnight had to come back in at 5AM the next day for Black Friday of course. (The store didn't close, in case it wasn't obvious.)\n\n&gt; In retail, if a customer is mean to you, you can just deal with them and then they're gone, you probably never see them again.\n\nBut there isn't always a way to deal with them because customers are not rational. Sometimes they're upset over something that doesn't even exist, a non-issue, something out of your control, something you're not allowed to do, etc. There isn't always a \"just deal with them\". If there was, it wouldn't even be an issue. And it doesn't really matter if you see them again, because for every one you deal with, two more will take it's place.\n\n&gt; No physical labor, unless you count standing. Try working construction, or landscaping, or pulling docks out of lakes all day at the end of summer. You're not going home hot/cold, wet, sore, sunburnt, and dehydrated from your work. In retail, you work indoors.\n\nI, personally, never had a problem with physical labor. The work was always within the realm of what I was already fit for, so while I might have been sore, I could bounce back without issue. I've always experienced way more break time from physically intensive jobs as well. And becoming more fit only made it easier, while I still haven't figured out how to train my feet to stop hurting after a week of standing and walking for 8 hours a day. When my body is sore, I don't really notice unless I use the sore muscles for something. So, worst case, I don't feel like going to the gym. If my feet hurt, I don't want to go anywhere that involves a lot of walking or standing, which is basically everything.\n\nBut also, and perhaps more importantly, these people usually get paid way more than retail employees.\n\n&gt; No risk of injury or personal danger. In any labor job, in any factory job, in any job involving a laboratory or workshop area, there\u2019s a perpetual and very real risk of injury. In retail, the most dangerous encounter you can have is if you\u2019re exceptionally poor at using a box cutter.\n\nAt the risk of repeating myself, those people usually get paid way more than retail employees and have forms of compensation in case they are injured. \n\n&gt; In a salaried engineering position, you often work just as poor or worse hours as a retail worker (I know several people in finance that are on 60+ hr weeks with weekend travel during this season) and during the spring I consistently work 50+ hour weeks as an engineer\n\nSure, but I'm sure you're still paid more than $8 an hour, and way more if you include all the intangible forms of compensation your job likely comes with.\n\n&gt; In retail, if you have a bad day, or are sick, or are hungover, and you don't get some critical stuff done, the world doesn't end. You get yelled at or are told to stay a bit late to fix it and it's no big deal or you just pass it off to the night shift to clean up your mess. In other jobs if you miss deadlines you literally do not get the work and the company loses tons of money.\n\nThe store will likely be fine, but if you can't come into work, you're not getting paid. So yeah, the company might be fine, but you might be fucked, along with the other stuff you said.\n\nAnd also, there is no way to work around it. There's no method of working at home if you want to get something done beforehand. Your deadlines can be manipulated to be on your terms. For retail, the shift is the shift, end of story. If there was a way to psychically fold shirts at home so they didn't have to worry about doing it at home, I'm sure they would.\n\nBut also, you get paid for the added responsibility of the deadline.\n\n&gt;  If you work in food, you smell like grease and food for the rest of your day after work. You also have to deal with the lunch/dinner rush and equally poor management/wages. I think it's worse than retail in every way.\n\nThere is also tons of complaints about working as a server, this doesn't make retail complaints any less valid. \n\nOut of curiosity, where exactly did you work in retail if it's not too personal of a question?
