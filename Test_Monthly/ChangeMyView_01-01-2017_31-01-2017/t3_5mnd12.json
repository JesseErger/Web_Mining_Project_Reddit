The only reason the US is allied with Saudi Arabia is because of access to cheap oil. The US cannot reasonably achieve its goals without access to this resource, so we reluctantly ally with the Saudi Arabian regime. Finally, Russia has an adversarial relationship with Russia. We could enter into an alliance with them, but I&amp;#39;m not confident that we can trust them, especially after the hacking during the election. Destablization of the US gives Russia much more power on the world stage and it looks like that is exactly what Putin wants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;People also make the argument that Trump is going to be a push over for Putin. Maybe. But we don&amp;#39;t know that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a reasonable fear isn&amp;#39;t it? Trump has proposed pulling out of NATO, which is the biggest defense in Europe against Russia. Without the US, NATO is crippled. He also has isolationist views on trade and foreign policy which would severely limit US influence. Trump has also refused to say a bad word about Putin or Russia in this election cycle. I haven&amp;#39;t heard a single criticism come out of his mouth. Even during this hacking scandal, both he and his advisors have refused to implicate Russia, despite the complete confidence of US intelligence agencies that Russia was to blame. Hell, Trump even praised Putin&amp;#39;s response to US sanctions. I see no precedent in his actions to believe that he will ever be tough on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc4vs7v", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5mnd12/cmv_wanting_an_alliance_with_russia_is_not_a_bad/dc4vs7v/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483860351.0, "author_flair_text": "54\u2206", "created_utc": 1483831551.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 5, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mnd12", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc5l9jy", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "heelspider", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5mnd12", "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "1) If we seek alliances with countries that attack us, doesn't that encourage more countries to attack us?\n\n2) Why are all of our current alliances in Europe a bad thing, and won't they be severely harmed by openly embracing Russia?\n\n3) What specifically does America get out of the arrangement?
