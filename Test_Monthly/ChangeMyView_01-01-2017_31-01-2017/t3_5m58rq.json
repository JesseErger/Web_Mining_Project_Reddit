There are programs like this already, and I think they would be of great benefit to everyone if they were expanded.  The student would have their debt forgiven and these understaffed schools would get some much needed new teachers.  That&amp;#39;s just one example, but you could do it with other types of programs.  For example, require new doctors to go serve a certain amount of time volunteering in a clinic or something.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand your point about distorting the labor market though.  I don&amp;#39;t see how this is going to cause an issue because I don&amp;#39;t think we are going to be flooded with unnecessary skills, as you say.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc0xdep", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5m58rq/cmv_student_debts_are_a_result_of_the_students/dc0xdep/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483634971.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483606171.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m58rq", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc1qqgm", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "stargazerAMDG", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5m58rq", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I can only really argue the first two points, since I tend to agree with the third point. \n\nIt's a bit wrong to say that college debts are caused by poor decisions when, for many, that's the only choice they had or that was the one they were pushed into. Trade jobs are not attractive jobs. Not everyone wants to be working with their hands all day. I know I would never want to be a plumber or car mechanic, not matter how much you paid me. And at the same time, college and 4 year degrees have become more of a required right of passage in the United States, than a place of higher education. It's seen as the next thing you do after high school. For most non-trade careers you need a four year degree to get a job, and sometimes you need even higher-level degrees than that. For example, if you want to be a high school teacher in some parts of the country you need a masters degree. \n\nRelatedly, you also have parents and teachers incorrectly telling kids that if they don't go to college they won't be successful. Unfortunately, that means everyone thinks they have to go to the big name expensive college over choosing to start at a community college for two years.\n\nMost first-time students go to college when they are 18 or 19. That's another big decision to hang over their heads. You have to know what you want to study and have for a career and know where you want to go. There's hundreds of majors, there's thousands of career fields and there are about 5,000 colleges in the United States. If you dont know what you want to do in four or five years you go off of what people tell you to do. For myself, my home state of Pennsylvania has over 250 schools. The area around me has at 57 colleges in the 50 mile area around me. If you're a teenager here, where do you start, do you pick the best one for your career path that's both affordable and going to help you get a job. It doesn't help when some of the cheap schools are seen as bad schools. For example, I could have gone to the one extremely cheap school near me when I went to college, but it's not respected by anyone (and for good reason too). You have many people around these kids telling them, they won't be successful unless they're ready to spend large amounts of money. And no one tells them it's hard to paying back large student loans. And if you're from a poor family, what are you supposed to do? You can't not get a college degree if you want to be a teacher, scientist, historian, or accountant. \n\nIt also doesn't help if you don't know about the sheer amount of scholarships available. It took until my junior year in college for me to find out about the thousands of private scholarships I could have applied to. The people that were supposed to be helping me in high school didn't even know what's out there. And I was a driven student that went to one of the best high schools in the country. How much help do you think little Jamie and Johnny are getting from the guidance counselors in a bad school with parents that know even less?\n\nAnd on the second point, in my opinion, Ivy Leagues are the worst colleges to use when looking at student debt. Depending on the college, if your family make under school set threshold you go for free, no loans, no worries. Princeton, for example, says if your family makes under $120,000 you attend for free, if you're under $250,000 you're getting at least half of your tuition covered by scholarships. The only students from Princeton and other Ivies that have student loan debt are going to be those from well-off families, the kind that can quickly repay loans or rely on an Ivy League degree and family connections getting them a high paying job. If you want to look at student debt, look at the statistics of those that go to state-rum schools. But even then, some states just don't care. New York wants to make their state schools free while Louisiana wants to scrap their merit scholarship program for low income students.\n\nNow yes, some students should know better than to spend $200,000 on an art degree but it doesn't help to have college prices rapidly rising every year. Every school is doing a bidding war trying to make they're campuses look bigger and better than their neighbors to get more students. Pointless administrators are getting larger salaries and bonuses every year because college is becoming a business.\n\nOn the third point I do agree that making college free for everyone would mess up the job market, but at the same time, if we push everyone into trade schools because they're cheaper that does the same thing. And there are solutions to the problems that could arise from making college free.
