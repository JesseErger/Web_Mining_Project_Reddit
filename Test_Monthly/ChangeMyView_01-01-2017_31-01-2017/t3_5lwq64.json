A lot of people haven&amp;#39;t been exposed to cheap and healthy eating, nor have they received an education on meal preparation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re talking personal finance, how would you know enough to google personal finance if you never learned anything about it? Again, ideally, you&amp;#39;d have a family passing on necessary skills, but sometimes the family itself doesn&amp;#39;t possess that knowledge. Therefore, the worst thing a personal finance class might do in a high school is be redundant to those that have already had the benefit of a familial education.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The point of all those plays and books you read in school was so you could get a well rounded view of politics, religion, and history.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not arguing against that. I think all knowledge is valuable, and I&amp;#39;m not saying Shakespeare is at all useless. None of the classes I suggested for replacement are useless. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of opportunities to learn these things, though, both in high school and beyond. You have STEM, literature, and history classes all throughout high school. I think that could easily be balanced with, literally, a couple of life skills classes that are just as, if not more practical in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbz432t", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lwq64/cmv_we_should_eliminate_certain_higherlevel_high/dbz432t/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483532622.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483503822.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbz2x9r", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ACrusaderA", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5lwq64", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Is it really the education system's job to teach you how to cook and do your personal finance?\n\nAren't those things better taught by the family and easily learned via Google?\n\nSchools don't teach Shakespeare because they think his works hold some secret to a perfect utopia.\n\nThey teach his works because they are mildly interesting, not extremely hard to understand, and most importantly are full of themes and evidence to support those themes which one can contrast against other ideas to build critical thought.\n\nThe point of all those plays and books you read in school was so you could get a well rounded view of politics, religion, and history.\n\nThere is a reason that the people who want to ban books have usually never read them.\n\nThe point is to build your ability to form arguments that you can find support for, which can then usually be applied to most every other part of day to day life.\n\nI do agree with you that trade schools should be emphasized more.

It's really easy to learn those things without mentorship. Higher-level high school classes require an understanding of nuance that is benefited by the back-and-forth that in-person classroom teaching can provide. Learning how to do your taxes, for most people, means reading the provided instructions. Learning how to boil an egg means going onto Wikihow for five minutes, but learning how to do chemical reactions with hazardous reactants requires in-person supervision from a qualified instructor.\n\n~~I concede that such classes require specialized instruction, and thus must be maintained in a classroom setting. That does not, however, change my practical understanding that in order to institute life skills classes, other classes must be cut. I would say that the burden of proof lies on me to prove that certain classes should be cut over others.~~\n\nI am not arguing against science or history or any of these things because they are bad to learn. Perhaps I was too harsh; these things are good, and in many cases help development of problem solving skills. \n\n~~My point is that its an issue of priorities. Learning how to manage the nuances of life and to be efficient &gt; learning the nuances of chemistry.~~\n\n~~In my school system, there were effectively 8 classes you could take at once in a given school year (give or take, some of them were only a semester). Unless you're arguing that we ought to extend the number of classes, if a student takes one class, they are in effect sacrificing another that they might have taken instead. If a total student schedule over a period of 4 years were filled and the only way to add in the aforementioned life skills classes were to cut out one or more other classes, I would argue first for eliminating certain higher-level STEM classes, simply because that knowledge, like it or not, is in 90% of cases probably going to be forgotten.~~\n\n~~Yes, you need a technical specialist to really appreciate a chemical reaction and manage an experiment safely, but how much lecture time is lost on people that aren't going to appreciate it in the first place?~~\n\n\n&gt; I think there's a good case to be made for education reform, but rather than choosing subjects that you think are more or less important, we should base them on which subjects are best learned in the classroom and which can be handled on your own.\n\n\nIn addition to the arguments you made above, I think you've made a good case here.

Maybe I'm arguing more of a cultural point here -- personal responsibility simply isn't as emphasized in the home, and **that** is why we see widespread ignorance on what seem to be basic things.

Learning how to boil an egg means going onto Wikihow for five minutes, but learning how to do chemical reactions with hazardous reactants requires in-person supervision from a qualified instructor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;I concede that such classes require specialized instruction, and thus must be maintained in a classroom setting. That does not, however, change my practical understanding that in order to institute life skills classes, other classes must be cut. I would say that the burden of proof lies on me to prove that certain classes should be cut over others.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not arguing against science or history or any of these things because they are bad to learn. Perhaps I was too harsh; these things are good, and in many cases help development of problem solving skills. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;My point is that its an issue of priorities. Learning how to manage the nuances of life and to be efficient &amp;gt; learning the nuances of chemistry.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;In my school system, there were effectively 8 classes you could take at once in a given school year (give or take, some of them were only a semester). Unless you&amp;#39;re arguing that we ought to extend the number of classes, if a student takes one class, they are in effect sacrificing another that they might have taken instead. If a total student schedule over a period of 4 years were filled and the only way to add in the aforementioned life skills classes were to cut out one or more other classes, I would argue first for eliminating certain higher-level STEM classes, simply because that knowledge, like it or not, is in 90% of cases probably going to be forgotten.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;Yes, you need a technical specialist to really appreciate a chemical reaction and manage an experiment safely, but how much lecture time is lost on people that aren&amp;#39;t going to appreciate it in the first place?&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think there&amp;#39;s a good case to be made for education reform, but rather than choosing subjects that you think are more or less important, we should base them on which subjects are best learned in the classroom and which can be handled on your own.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to the arguments you made above, I think you&amp;#39;ve made a good case here. Disregard all that I crossed out, I think I needed to mull over what you said more before I shot off a reply, as I was missing the point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing I have to argue against is that while I provided overly simplistic examples (ie boil an egg), I think that you underestimate the sheer lack of knowledge that people have regarding personal finance. Maybe I&amp;#39;m arguing more of a cultural point here -- personal responsibility simply isn&amp;#39;t as emphasized in the home, and &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; is why we see widespread ignorance on what seem to be basic things. Maybe a classroom won&amp;#39;t change that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbz3dur", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lwq64/cmv_we_should_eliminate_certain_higherlevel_high/dbz3dur/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483531568.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483502768.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbz2v1c", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RAGING_VEGETARIAN", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5lwq64", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I think there's a good case to be made for education reform, but rather than choosing subjects that you think are more or less important, we should base them on which subjects are best learned in the classroom and which can be handled on your own.\n\n&gt;(I know how to do these things, I'm just making a point).\n\nA bad one, apparently.
