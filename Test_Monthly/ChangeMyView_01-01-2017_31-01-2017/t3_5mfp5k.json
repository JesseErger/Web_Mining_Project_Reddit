Sure, not racially profiling is good, but that should be nowhere near the forefront of your mind.\n\nThe problem is your swagger, self-awareness, and inner willingness to become tremendously violent on a moment's notice. \n\nAs others have suggested, walking with heavy feet and swinging your legs slightly does make your look more confident, but that is useless if your are oblivious to the environment around you, and actually detrimental if your overdo it because you then look like an overcompensating beta, or someone who is looking for a fight which would only attract more attention. \n\nLet me give you an example. Lets say you are walking down the street when you notice a dude on the other side start to cross over. It's clear that he will reach your side of the street and cross paths with you. \nIf you react by diverting your eyes and pretending that its not happening, or perhaps by reminding yourself that his skin color does not make him a criminal, you are going to get mugged. \n\nIf instead you make eye contact, don't miss a step in your confident stride, then place your right hand in your pocket while leaving your left hand out and dangling, this changes things entirely.\n\nThe approaching guy will see your confidence, see that you are acknowledging his approach with eye contact, and show that you are ready to escalate to what could possibly be a gun or knife in your pocket. You don't actually need to have anything in your pocket at all, but the threat of the unknown could deter the situation entirely. \n\nYou see, criminals are looking for easy prey. Unaware prey is even better. All you have to do is play the game, use some clear non-verbal communication to indicate that you are indeed aware, are not prey, and are willing to escalate to incredible violence. \n\nThis last bit is important. You need to be willing to go from being a pleasant civilian to a monster willing to rip, tear, bite, punch, kick, choke, etc on a moments notice. This makes pretending to be confident easier. The best kind of bluff is one that is not a bluff. \n\nFor instance if you actually had a gun in your pocket as the criminal crosses the street, and you put one hand in your pocket on it, you would not need to pretend like you had a contingency, you would know, and simply communicating that truth non-verbally would be more convincing than any bluff.\n\nSo it naturally follows that being willing to be suddenly violent can have the same effect. Knowing that you can flip a mental switch and go wild can add that confidence without having to pretend. \nAdmittedly, this is not something everyone can do. But it can be learned. Join a MMA or BJJ gym and learn to fight. This can help give that inner confidence and ability to \"flip the switch\". \n\nSo to recap, observe basic human psychology, watch people, walk with confidence, use strong non-verbals, bluff, and learn to fight. Also... walk in groups when possible, groups are not easy prey. \n\n\nOne last comment. Others have suggested getting a gun, and I even alluded to it as a possibility. Do not do this unless you are willing to go to actual gun training classes, regularly train with it, and be zealously monk-like with how stringently you follow safety practices. Gun culture is complex and will require weeks of research and years of permanent commitment. You must also be willing to end another life... which is no small consideration. \nBut I must make it clear, while owing a gun can help, it will not communicate the non-verbals for you and it will not help you be more aware of your surroundings and people scoping you out. If you ignore everything I said about swagger, confidence, non-verbals, bluffing, the criminal shadow dance, awareness, not being prey etc and then go out and buy a gun, then you are guaranteeing the next time you are mugged that someone is going to die. The whole point is avoidance if at all possible, remember that. \n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are going about this all wrong.\nA positive non-racist and ethical outlook on people is good, but it lacks anything pragmatic. Sure, not racially profiling is good, but that should be nowhere near the forefront of your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is your swagger, self-awareness, and inner willingness to become tremendously violent on a moment&amp;#39;s notice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As others have suggested, walking with heavy feet and swinging your legs slightly does make your look more confident, but that is useless if your are oblivious to the environment around you, and actually detrimental if your overdo it because you then look like an overcompensating beta, or someone who is looking for a fight which would only attract more attention. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me give you an example. Lets say you are walking down the street when you notice a dude on the other side start to cross over. It&amp;#39;s clear that he will reach your side of the street and cross paths with you. \nIf you react by diverting your eyes and pretending that its not happening, or perhaps by reminding yourself that his skin color does not make him a criminal, you are going to get mugged. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If instead you make eye contact, don&amp;#39;t miss a step in your confident stride, then place your right hand in your pocket while leaving your left hand out and dangling, this changes things entirely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The approaching guy will see your confidence, see that you are acknowledging his approach with eye contact, and show that you are ready to escalate to what could possibly be a gun or knife in your pocket. You don&amp;#39;t actually need to have anything in your pocket at all, but the threat of the unknown could deter the situation entirely. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see, criminals are looking for easy prey. Unaware prey is even better. All you have to do is play the game, use some clear non-verbal communication to indicate that you are indeed aware, are not prey, and are willing to escalate to incredible violence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This last bit is important. You need to be willing to go from being a pleasant civilian to a monster willing to rip, tear, bite, punch, kick, choke, etc on a moments notice. This makes pretending to be confident easier. The best kind of bluff is one that is not a bluff. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance if you actually had a gun in your pocket as the criminal crosses the street, and you put one hand in your pocket on it, you would not need to pretend like you had a contingency, you would know, and simply communicating that truth non-verbally would be more convincing than any bluff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it naturally follows that being willing to be suddenly violent can have the same effect. Knowing that you can flip a mental switch and go wild can add that confidence without having to pretend. \nAdmittedly, this is not something everyone can do. But it can be learned. Join a MMA or BJJ gym and learn to fight. This can help give that inner confidence and ability to &amp;quot;flip the switch&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to recap, observe basic human psychology, watch people, walk with confidence, use strong non-verbals, bluff, and learn to fight. Also... walk in groups when possible, groups are not easy prey. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One last comment. Others have suggested getting a gun, and I even alluded to it as a possibility.

It's my favorite show and it's about the drug trade in Baltimore, society, and the nature of people- I HIGHLY recommend watching it. I live near Baltimore and I STILL feel it gave me a LOT of perspective.\n\nGoing off of what I've learned, black culture itself has just been pretty fucked for some time now. These areas where they grow up are simply places where rich white people no longer wanted to live in and have ultimately been forsaken. The environment itself is of a lower standard because people don't care about it and often doesn't get the funding it needs: worse living standards, worse education, worse police, and I imagine worse politics too. No one gives a fuck about maintaining a trash can.\n\nThe culture has become one of hatred where there is little to no trust. People feel they have been taken advantage of and, thus, look for other people to take advantage of so others feel their pain as well. They collectively come to believe that's how the world works- you're either fucking someone or you're getting fucked yourself. That's why drug selling is such a big thing in these kinds of places: the easiest person to take advantage of is a drug addict. Kids growing up in these poor environments grow to believe that there's nothing else out there for them- that no one wants to give a nigger a new home outside the ghetto. Taking advantage of drug addicts, thieving, etc. are all more guaranteed sources of income in their eyes than any promises their poor schools can offer them.\n\nThere's also this ego complex in these poor environments, but that's a bit more complicated. I've met black people that get SUPER offended if they get even the TINIEST hint that someone might think that they're superior to them- even if it wasn't directly communicated by the perpetrator. Sometimes, so much as seeing someone in expensive clothes triggers them to the point of attacking- simply because \"they think they're better than me and need to be take down a couple notches.\" There's not much to do in these poor neighborhoods other than socialize with the other poor people, so they get to a point where respect means the world to them and disrespect is completely unacceptable. The culture romanticizes this idea of being an alpha-male or apex predator- someone everyone respects and no one disrespects. That becomes their purpose because they've already resigned themselves to life in the ghetto. If you find someone who disrespects you, beat the shit out of him or kill him. Make the streets fear you. Make the streets respect you... or die trying.\n\nIt's all in the environment, in my opinion. I know plenty of black people that are not influenced by that culture- probably because they didn't grow up in it. My sister's black fiancee is definitely my best example. We grew up with him in a better part of Maryland and he's always been dedicated to our church community and schoolwork- despite being black, poor, and fatherless. He's way smarter than me in my major of computer science often tutoring me when I ask. He graduated from the best college in Maryland in 4 years and now has a tech job in government security that he's not even allowed to tell me or my sister about. All I know is he now makes a SHIT load of money has been spending quite a bit of it on my sister... but I won't get into that. His face only makes 2 expressions: happy and confused. I literally can't even imagine his face angry. Honestly, I think he's a freak. I think he's too perfect to be human and that his brain is not mentally normal.\n\nSo, yeah, that's a black person I know. It really is unfair to judge someone by the color of their skin. Try to think more about where you are and what kind of people that environment can create. That kind of thinking better prepares you for your own safety. \"If I have to be in this place, I shouldn't be alone.\" That kind of thinking.", "edited": 1483750681.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I actually learned a lot about society and the culture of impoverished black areas from watching this show &amp;quot;The Wire&amp;quot;.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with profiling people based on skin color, the unfortunate truth is that there is some weight placed on it. Even if you don't want to, everyone else is going to. Even if I am be very pessimistic, exaggerating just how many people actually do use skin color as a way to influence myself by saying everyone does, we both know I am not wrong to imply it's the majority. \n\n\nThe unfortunate truth is, the problem is the uneducated community. It doesn't matter by skin color, low class makes low quality people. They're angry their lives are bottom class, they are raised to blame the top. They're angry at how everything is, they take their anger out on targets they can easily justify. Sometimes, that heavily includes racism. \n\n\nI know you do not want to racially profile people, but for safety it may be necessary. You're handling racism all wrong, you're not magically a bigot for using common sense. It varies by EVERY neighborhood, but it goes both ways depending on the part of the country you're in. For example, black people might have to assume all whites are bigots just for their safety in some parts of the country. You happen to be in the part where you're just going to need to have a little bit of edge against blacks you don't know. Is it wrong you have to racially profile? Yes. Does it make you a bigot? Nope. \n\n\nYou know what does make you a bigot? Thinking blacks are the way they are because of genetics. These negative qualities, they're definitely inherited by their families they have descended from. However, they did not inherited these negative qualities through genetics, black people are not naturally more criminal or dangerous. True bigots think otherwise. Bigots think ALL blacks are problem people and think it is because of their race rather than their social class. What you need to do is look at a poor person and ask yourself: do I think this individual is the type to put me in danger? If they're poor, probably. If they're black, probably. I don't know your neighborhood. Where I'm at, criminals come in all shades of colors so I gotta be a bit careful around all races. However, this isn't true in ALL neighborhoods. Sometimes, there is such a thing as black communities.\n\n\nTo enlighten you with a certain level of perspective, these black communities are precisely the problem. When you have slaves and you're no longer legally allowed to keep them, what do you do? You let them go, you guess. If you want them to be successful in society, what do you do? You rehabilitate them. If you're a slaver, would you want them to be successful? No, there is a small chance it's proof these individuals are more fit with slavery, in fact this would prove they NEED slavery. So you let them go. Now these primitives that are absolutely different from the rest of the human race are aimlessly trying to human in a society they were not raised in nor taught how to be successful in, on top of it they're in a society that has an unfavorable bias towards them. On a scale of 1-10, how successful do you think they're gonna be? Correct, they're off the scale at a terrible 0. There is not a whole lot of exceptions, like they got a lot of jobs as maids and stuff. You know, stuff slaves are genetically designed for. \n\n\nSo, here you are, you got a bunch of blacks running around in a society that is pushing them away and not teaching them how to cope in the world, surely they'll get better, right? Well, naturally they would, except we decided to make things complicated. We decided to create black ghettos to keep these natural born criminals in their own areas away from us self victimizing white people. So, yeah, here you are with otherwise perfectly functioning normal people, all they needed was some rehabilitation to be successful, but instead we not only gave them no rehabilitation to help them be successful but we also distanced them from us \"normal\" people that any chance of learning how to cope with our society is slim. They don't get to watch us, learn from us, or anything. No, these people get to be in a society filled with equally lost people, time passing by.\n\nThe results? Well, bitterness, hatred, various survival skills typically associated with criminal activity, all of that is passed down. Why not wealth being passed down? Well, your parents are required to have wealth in order to pass down to you, but you get that shitty ass ghetto house though in that black neighborhood where you belong, that's always cool, except you got a lot of back taxes to pay. What about anything else, did you get any meaningful lessons when raised by your parents? Nah, the blind leading the blind is a metaphor highly relevant here. All the black people that were something special slowly leaves the neighborhoods and leaves you suckers behind. It cannot possibly be your fault though, you tried. Clearly, it's the white people's fault, that is a historic fact, why not a modern one as well? \n\n\nYou do not have to racially profile if you don't want to. You can always just be absolutely safe, absolutely careful. Some of us do because we understand that statistics don't lie. These statistics are very bad though, they do not co-align well with our progressive bias that is anti-racial influenced beliefs. However, data does not lie. The best thing you can do is use the data, but understand why it's true. The full truth is absolutely complicated, I over simplified it. There is also conspiracies such as prisons wanting more prisoners so they made laws in order to specifically target blacks (as well Hispanics!) or even the media preaching a specific role to blacks to maintain their negative aspects of their very unique sub-culture. \n\n\nHowever, knowing all of this and using for you're safety, you're not suddenly a bigot or a racist. It's not anymore racist than a black person keeping their guard up in an all white neighborhood in the south full of confederate flags. Not all people that are obsessed with confederate flags are racist, but you bet your ass a lot of them are. As a black person, even if it's wrong to say it's white people in general, you gotta do what keeps you safe and that's keep your guard up. \n\n\ntl;dr: There is absolutely nothing wrong with racially profiling people if the community calls it for internal defensive purposes. If you're not actively inflecting judgement, you're just keeping your guard up, you're harming nobody. As far as racism is concerned, there's a huge difference with believing blacks are dangerous because of their genetics than saying there is a lot of low class blacks in your area and they're consistently proving to be dangerous. You know not all blacks are like that, but you need to also know that your area there is a lot that are. \n\n\nStay safe, continue to be open minded, but do not fall too far into the politically correct minded spectrum. Race is a very complex subject, we as a part of society, and all types of societies, made it even more complicated. We as humans naturally wish to create smaller tribes for ourselves as well single out smaller groups as our enemies. One of the greatest filters we came up with was skin color (though, surprisingly, this is fairly new! It used to be nationalities!). With that said, even if you do not wish to do it, sometimes others will against you. Nothing wrong acknowledging it as a risk and nothing wrong with subscribing to consistent experiences or data for your personal safety as long you don't use it to negative impact the lives of others whom are potentially innocent. Racial profiling is only wrong with police officers because they have the power to ruin lives that are innocent, they do not racially profile by watching blacks but by stopping them and their daily tasks to look for something wrong. THAT is wrong, not understanding there is a lot of bottom class people of specific races in your area that have members within that community that are consistently dangerous.
