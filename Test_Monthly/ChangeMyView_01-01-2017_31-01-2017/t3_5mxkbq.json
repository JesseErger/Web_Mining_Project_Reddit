Any belief can be logically held provided that the information upon which it is based leads the believer to that conclusion.

People can be wrong without knowing they are wrong. People who possess information that does not accurately reflect reality will use that information to logically arrive at beliefs that do not accurately reflect reality. They arrived at the beliefs logically regardless. \n\nWhen you were a child, you were told Santa Claus exists. All the discoverable evidence pointed to his existence being true: presents appeared under your tree, people talked about him, drew pictures of him, explained how he could exist in a way you couldn't directly perceive. You wrote him a letter and he responded. \n\nBased upon this, you logically arrived at the conclusion that Santa Claus was real. Was this a true belief? Of course not.
