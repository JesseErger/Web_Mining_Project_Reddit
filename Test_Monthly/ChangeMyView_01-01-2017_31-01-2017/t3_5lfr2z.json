If a gay man is sexually abused by another man, this might understandably lead to conflicted feelings about later sexual expression, which is a common problem for many survivors of such trauma, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. However, this abuse does not change an individual's sexuality (straight to gay, or vice versa), and trying to repress a victim's natural sexual urges is likely to hinder to actual recovery. Similarly, blaming bad parenting, in this case paternal abandonment, for homosexuality is a woefully outdated theory, with no real evidence to support it. While these kinds of rationals were used in the earliest days of psychotherapy, the field has since rejected them as being outright false. On a final note, I don't even know what to say about the comparison of  homosexuality to addiction. There isn't a drop of evidence to support this supposed link, and to be frank the fact that Nicolosi is trying to tie the two together is almost surreal in its wrongness. \n\nSo, having established that Nicolosi's underlying theories aren't in any way supported, we can start talking about why his therapy absolutely should be banned. If homosexuality isn't the result of trauma or abandonment, but instead is a innate biological characteristic, trying to change it via therapy is absolutely futile. At best you would be wasting time, but at worst you would be inflicting a form of **psychological torture**, making individuals feel upset by their own natural sexual urges. Making matters worse, Nicolosi seems to be perverting therapies that are actually useful for trauma survivors, like EMDR, for his own dangerous intents.
