Here are a few things:\n\n**Why cold?**\n\n-  Yes, it saves energy- this is a no-brainer and why I usually use cold water.\n-  Cold water keeps colors from bleeding- another big one\n-  Clothes won't shrink as much in cold water, although the dryer basically negates using cold water.\n-  Cold water won't \"set\" stains.  With hot water, protein based stains like blood, for example, will set.  The reason is because hot water breaks those proteins down and virtually binds them with the fabric.  It's a bad idea to wash blood, animal fat/grease, poop, or other protein based stains in hot water.  The things is, sometime you don't know what has those stains on them, so cold is better. \n-  A lot of the perception for hot water is this:  We bath in hot water, we wash dishes in hot water, we wash our hands with hot water... *hot water must be better at cleaning*.  Cold water is slightly less efficient at dissolving, but it still works just fine.  Your clothes don't care about the temperature. \n- Cold water does not affect the stiffness of the clothes.  Whether you hang dry or tumble dry, the temperature of both items will change to either hot (in a dryer) or room temp (hung) before they actually dry.  \n\n**Why hot?**\n\n-  Hot water is a slightly better solvent.  When it comes to things like white clothes, there is no color to bleed and it may help the clothes appear whiter. \n-  It may help sanitize.  Depending on how hot your water gets (mine gets scalding), it could kill some bacteria/germs.  The water heater at your house has to maintain a certain temp to keep some microorganisms from growing.  So things like white sheets, towels, white underwear (sans poop stains), etc, would be better in hot water. \n\nSo when it comes down to it, cold is the better option almost every time.  It's not that much worse of a solvent.  The hot water also doesn't do a *great* job with sanitizing. \n\nWhy don't you all compromise and run it on \"warm\"?  The big benefit there is that it uses less energy than hot and also in most washers, it fills up almost twice as fast.  I use warm sometimes for no reason other than it finishes 10 minutes sooner.  Just don't use it if suspect something being badly stained.\n\nThen again, I'm not an expert.  Just someone who reads weird shit.
