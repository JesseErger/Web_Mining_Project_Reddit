But isn't mystery in essence something that is entirely unknown TO YOU? Sure, you say, but what I do not know, I can quickly learn from others on the internet. And I'd fully disagree with you on that - there is a wealth of mystery out there that cannot be learned from books, or from the internet or from documentaries. These mysteries that can only be answered from first hand experiences.\n\nLet's use travel as the easiest example, although I could argue there could be equally as much mystery in the intricacies of something in your own town. But travel has the most glaring mysteries so we'll start there. First, go. Take 30 days off work, travel to a remote village in Bavaria, rent a room with a host family, and learn. Learn their customs, their language, their cuisine, their beliefs. Make mistakes, get reprimanded. Learn their stories, their weird superstitions, their sayings that when you finally figure out and translate literally back into your language make you scratch your head. Use their appliances, big things and little things. Showers will be different. Light-switches will be different. They will be reminiscent to yours but are all... well... somehow mysteriously different. Sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse.\n\nThis mystery will be something unfamiliar to you. It will be uncomfortable. It will be hard. It will not come all at once, like spotting land on the horizon of some new shore. But it will make you wonder. It will make you look at life and all of its routines and mundane objects, and it will make you realize that there could be a different way. It will make you question. Sometimes it will make you cry with frustration and you'll wish for nothing more for the mystery to go away and for things to make sense again. Other times you'll realize that the way they do a certain thing back where you're from is far inferior and you wonder why this different way never caught on.\nThat's mystery.
