While it&amp;#39;s good to debate about the future and try to figure out how to adjust to advances like automation, it isn&amp;#39;t really a good argument to say that automation is causing the death spiral in America because no one can really accurately say what is going to happen in 10, 20, 30 years, or longer depending on when automation actually starts replacing workers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can assail me for &amp;quot;my&amp;quot; alleged &amp;quot;made up future where automation has taken over America&amp;quot;, but your unwillingness to even entertain the idea of it is beyond absurd.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, you misunderstood what I said. I&amp;#39;m not saying a future in which America is entirely automated is entirely unrealistic.

You left out the word &amp;quot;your&amp;quot; before your quote, which is really the emphasis of the sentence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then again, when someone called you out in another thread about Delaware being a tax haven and provided sources to back their claim, you called them wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off, you looked up my history just because of this discussion? Lol. Second, I provided a source, because they were and are wrong. They continued a discussion that I had no interest in so I left it alone, but truly Delaware is not a tax haven like Ireland is, and they were misusing the expression. It&amp;#39;s not like I stuck my tongue out and said &amp;quot;nuh-uh&amp;quot;. I provided material for them to look into. They didn&amp;#39;t want to, and I didn&amp;#39;t care enough to teach them what they did not want to learn.

One, that we've been recovering from a recession in the 1980s and have been growing since then to get back to \"normal\". Number two is the question of whether or not real wages should be growing. Purchasing power remains the same. Has the US been growing in power significantly since 1980? Or are we in about the same position relative to then? Why would we expect the whole country to just continue getting richer and richer? Scarcity is a real thing, and I'm not sure it's realistic to see steady and consistent growth in real wages. Flat is what I would expect for as long as the US is a stable 1st world superpower.

There is not a 1:1 ratio between demand for AI engineers or machine learning developers or general software engineers and automated appliances. \n\nYes, job prospects for the highly skilled in the realm of software development, robotics, AI, and machine learning are good. But as a percentage of the total economy, how many jobs is that? Not everyone has the same aptitudes, nor the same desires in the economy. Not everyone can be a super niche, high tech worker in the Service Economy (TM). Not everyone can tread among the elite. Do you understand that? Because you rightly note that the \"best and brightest are rewarded for their talents\". \n\nI know you'll probably bring up the financial services industry as a growth industry, even in the face of automation. But a startup called Kensho is developing an algorithm to replace entry level and mid-tier analyst jobs and it's doing quite well (https://hbr.org/2016/12/wall-street-jobs-wont-be-spared-from-automation). High frequency trading and other online trading platforms have all but obviated the need for people working the floor of the NYSE. Automation has been lumbering along for years in the finance sector and it's just now picking up some serious steam. And when you consider what the human element at Wells Fargo exacted on its unwitting customers, maybe that's for the best.\n\nSure. I'm in favor of a meritocracy. However, what I'm discussing here is more fundamental than the very successful person vs. the average successful person. I'm talking about an economy in which most people are in the \"precariat\" and essentially end up living hand-to-mouth because of a lack of training, a lack of opportunity, and a lack of capital investment from their employers. \n\n\nBusinesses are increasingly hesitant to spend money, even though unemployment is at historic lows* and our Fed's easy money policies have made it trivial for companies to obtain capital, invest, and stimulate growth.

Denying automation won&amp;#39;t change its march into the future. Jobs and aspects of jobs are being automated &lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt;, not 30 years in the future. The sophistication of AI, machine learning, and robotics will only improve over time. By 2050, I think you&amp;#39;ll see an entirely different landscape for work than you do now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the long term, maybe automation and job elimination will turn out to be a net positive, once the economy figures out where to sort everyone while keeping unemployment from reaching catastrophic levels. But to suggest that automation won&amp;#39;t hurt employment, which will in turn hurt the economy, in the mid-term is ridiculous. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Automation and increases in efficiency on the supply side does nothing to stimulate demand. If too many people are scraping by and have very little disposable income, aggregate demand drops and the companies that spent so much time and money automating their processes see depressed revenues and profits. In short, if no one can buy your shit, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter how cheaply you can produce your shit. Globalization cuts both ways. As technologies change in the U.S., they&amp;#39;re sure to change sooner or later in the rest of the post-industrialized world, as well. If low aggregate demand becomes an issue here, a company could just refocus on a country with a lot more people, like China, while charging less per item sold, right? But that seems to be the economic version of kicking the can down the road. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your assertion that automation will create jobs or opportunities we can&amp;#39;t yet conceive of is a familiar reprise among the &amp;quot;everything is going to be awesome&amp;quot; crowd on the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, you seem to fail to recognize the novelty of automation: it&amp;#39;s never been done before.

Further, the article goes on to clarify that this isn't necessarily a bad thing since not everyone should own a home, and that affordability is making people more cautious of buying one. Homes require a downpayment and a decent credit score, and if you can't build up either you shouldn't be buying a house. They are a lot of responsibility that people are unprepared for. So again, this isn't necessarily a bad thing and is a bad statistic to use to gauge the economic health of the us.\n\n77 million have debt in collections - this is what, 25% of the population? Given that a certain portion of the population is poor, a certain amount of the population has had businesses fail, catastrophic medical bills, etc., this isn't necessarily surprising. On one hand it might look bad in that people can't pay bills or the medical system has ruined them financially, but on the other hand, people were still able to get credit and medical help in the first place, which is a lot better than you can say about a *lot* of places in the world.\n\n76% are living paycheck - title bait. 76% don't have at least 6 months of cash in savings according to the article, which is entirely a different thing. So this one is entirely bullshit.\n\nRent rising faster than wages - not necessarily a problem depending on how you look at it. I haven't studied this one much and am on mobile so didn't want to put in the effort to get around the paywall, but does that mean that wages are becoming too low *necessarily*? Example: if wages were stagnant across the country, literally 0 change from the previous year, but rents are raised in certain areas that had previously underpriced rent bringing it up to reasonable/market levels, is that a bad thing, or is that just adjustment to a fair market?\n\n1.2 trillion in student debt - first off, this *shouldn't* be dischargeable debt, because who in their right mind would pay off 200k in debt against no assets rather than discharge it via bankruptcy? The debt not being dischargeable allows people to go to college because without that, the interest rates would be astronomical to account for the risk of bankruptcy. Second, a lot of that debt isn't bad debt. My brother's boyfriend is 100k in school debt, but it allowed him to get his bachelor's and master's in accounting and now he makes a pretty good salary and can and will pay it back. Is that a bad thing? It's only bad debt if the person who holds it made a stupid fucking decision and went to a shitty college and got a shitty degree that isn't in demand and can't generate money from it. Those people invested poorly and now are stuck with the debt related to their decision. Consequences exist in the real world.\n\nMillennials are increasingly unable to afford homes - there's a lot that goes into this, including low housing inventory that's partially due to baby boomers being old and not moving around a lot. In 20-30 years when they die off, were going to see very affordable housing spring up due to high inventory if demand is the same. This is by and large a population age distribution issue, not simply an economic one.\n\nAutomation - this doesn't fit with your argument because this is not reality in *present day America*. Sure, you can make an argument that automation will wipe out a ton of jobs. But I could make the argument that people have been predicting that for decades and yet we still keep adding jobs to the economy, or the argument that our economic system will adjust to automation, or that the world economy will shift toward an entirely service based economy, or any million other arguments. But none of that matters, because none of that is reality right now and it is all conjecture. You can't throw automation into an argument about present day economic systems just as I can't throw in terraforming Mars into an argument about present day space travel. You should consider removing this from your cmv because it does not at all fit with the rest of your overall argument.\n\nYou say how can you be optimistic about future success? You aren't guaranteed success. That's the thing about America, and always has been true about america - it's a place where the best and brightest are rewarded for their talents and the average do average and the least talented are poor. People love European countries because there's such a high floor, but a lot of high performers in Europe come to America because America pays the best for talented people. If you're average or below average, you shouldn't feel optimistic about your future financial success. You have to make that for yourself. The country has had the same brutal outlook for its history, that's not a change from the past because it's always been this way.\n\nOur political system is deeply divided because that's the way it was designed. Our country was designed to be hard to make radical changes to, and it's functioning accordingly. Is that an issue? Maybe. Maybe not. We're slower to change for the better but we also dont make big fuck ups as easily.\n\nPrisons overflowing for different reasons. We're becoming more progressive towards drugs which should alleviate some of that issue, but we're also a much more violent country than a lot of other countries. So while I do think our prison population is too high, the part of that issue that should be solved is being solved by drug reform. That's a definite sign of improvement.\n\nJustice system isn't broken. It's working as it's supposed to. Just because people are wasting time and money on stupid cases doesn't mean the system isn't working as designed.\n\nThe jobs part... Some are being offshored and should be because that's economically sound. Sucks for the individual, good for the US in terms of economic production. Same with automation and elimination - it means companies are becoming more efficient. That's good for the whole. Again, sucks for the individual that loses his job, but that's the way the world works as a whole. I'm not grieving for the 1800s farm migrant worker whose job was eliminated by the advent of the tractor. Yours is a very regressive viewpoint here. H1B visas are pretty demonized here on reddit, but they're not a bad thing either, and I'm not sure you understand them based on what you wrote. They're not lower wage workers. They have high wage requirements and fulfill roles where companies need talent and are having a hard time finding it here. There are some issues with H1B involving knowledge transfer, but that's an entirely separate issue, and H1B visas on the whole are not a substitute for American workers but rather an importing of talent that the US does not have enough of on a temporary basis.\n\nOur manufacturing is still a huge part of our country. Generated 5.9 trillion, more than 35% of our GDP. Just because we've become more efficient and there are fewer manufacturing jobs here doesn't mean the sector has dried up.\n\nWe have a lot to show for our military. Huge amounts of that are R&amp;D. Not to mention that it supports a great deal of our economy because the government essentially employs a fuckton of soldiers and bankrolls a large amount of defense related companies. Their return on that investment is both technological advancement, economic stimulation, and generally a much more stable world. To say that we get little in return for military spending is short sighted and ignores the benefits that it provides the world as a whole, which we operate in. It's like being mad at having a police force because in your town because they don't produce any tangible goods.\n\nPersonal debt is up for a lot of reasons and you can head over to /r/economics for more on that, but saying that as if it's a point in and of itself is silly. People have always been afraid of retiring. Social security likely is in trouble. Gig work is not becoming the new economy, it just is a new way of working. People on tinder have many more options for love now, rather than just the girls that go to the bar in their hometown, seems like an improvement to me.\n\nPublic schools aren't failing as a whole. Although I agree that some reforms should be made to the system, saying that they're in somehow a sorrier state than they were 15 years ago is pretty off base. They're teaching more to more students today. Some colleges are echo chambers. The good ones aren't.\n\nI can't tell you what the future holds. But going off what America is today, nothing really indicates the great and inevitable decline that you're talking about. You take a very pessimistic, very sensationalist view of America, and you've been caught up in the most negative parts of reddit's honestly reactionary, biased, and oftentimes braindead flailing about with regards to the economy. Read more /r/economics, read less /r/politics. Read more Bloomberg, read less WSJ. Pay less attention to the people on reddit (ironic coming from someone on reddit), because although a lot of people here think they're economic savants, they're mostly no better than your average voter. Their 28 ACT scores and mediocre programming skills aren't nearly as impressive as they think they are.\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s talk about a few of your premises:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Half of Americans can&amp;#39;t afford their homes - this is qualified in the article as half of Americans had to make a &amp;#39;major sacrifice&amp;#39; to make a mortgage payment, which is a problematic definition in the first place.
