The first, usually labelled the \u2018contact hypothesis\u2019, argues that diversity fosters interethnic tolerance and social solidarity. As we have more contact with people who are unlike us, we overcome our initial hesitation and ignorance and come to trust them more...Evidence of this sort suggested to social psychologists, beginning with Gordon Allport in the 1950s, the optimistic hypothesis that if we have more contact with people of other ethnic and racial backgrounds (or at least more contact in the right circumstances), we will all begin to trust one another more. More formally, according to this theory, diversity reduces ethnocentric attitudes and fosters out-group trust and solidarity. If black and white children attend the same schools, for example, race relations will improve. This logic was an important part of the legal case that led the United States Supreme Court to require racial desegregation in the famous Brown v. Board of Education case in 1954. For progressives, the contact theory is alluring, but I think it is fair to say that most (though not all) empirical studies have tended instead to support the so-called \u2018conflict theory\u2019, which suggests that, for various reasons \u2013 but above all, contention over limited resources \u2013 diversity fosters out-group distrust and in-group solidarity. On this theory, the more we are brought into physical proximity with people of another race or ethnic background, the more we stick to \u2018our own\u2019 and the less we trust the \u2018other\u2019 (Blumer 1958; Blalock 1967; Giles &amp;amp; Evans 1986; Quillian 1995, 1996; Brewer &amp;amp; Brown 1998; Taylor 1998; Bobo 1999; Bobo &amp;amp; Tuan 2006)...\nThe evidence that diversity and solidarity are negatively correlated (controlling for many potentially confounding variables) comes from many different settings:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across workgroups in the United States, as well as in Europe, internal heterogeneity (in terms of age, professional background, ethnicity, tenure and other factors) is generally associated with lower group cohesion, lower satisfaction and higher turnover (Jackson et al. 1991; Cohen &amp;amp; Bailey 1997; Keller 2001; Webber &amp;amp; Donahue 2001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across countries, greater ethnic heterogeneity seems to be associated with lower social trust (Newton &amp;amp; Delhey 2005; Anderson &amp;amp; Paskeviciute 2006; but see also Hooghe et al. 2006).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across local areas in the United States, Australia, Sweden, Canada and Britain, greater ethnic diversity is associated with lower social trust and, at least in some cases, lower investment in public goods (Poterba 1997; Alesina et al. 1999; Alesina &amp;amp; La Ferrara 2000, 2002; Costa &amp;amp; Kahn 2003b; Vigdor 2004; Glaeser &amp;amp; Alesina 2004; Leigh 2006; Jordahl &amp;amp; Gustavsson 2006; Soroka et al. 2007; Pennant 2005; but see also Letki forthcoming).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Peruvian micro-credit cooperatives, ethnic heterogeneity is associated with higher default rates; across Kenyan school districts ethnolinguistic diversity is associated with less voluntary fundraising; and in Himalayan Pakistan, clan, religious, and political diversity are linked with failure of collective infrastructure maintenance (Karlan 2002; Miguel &amp;amp; Gugerty 2005; Khwaja 2006).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across American census tracts, greater ethnic heterogeneity is associated with lower rates of car-pooling, a social practice that embodies trust and reciprocity (Charles &amp;amp; Kline 2002).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within experimental game settings such as prisoners-dilemma or ultimatum games, players who are more different from one another (regardless of whether or not they actually know one another) are more likely to defect (or \u2018cheat\u2019). Such results have been reported in many countries, from Uganda to the United States (Glaeser et al. 2000; Fershtman &amp;amp; Gneezy 2001; Eckel &amp;amp; Grossman 2001; Willinger et al. 2003; Bouckaert &amp;amp; Dhaene 2004; Johansson-Stenman et al. 2005; Gil-White 2004; Habyarimana et al. 2006).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the Union (northern) Army in the American Civil War, the casualty rate was very high and the risks of punishment for desertion were very low, so the only powerful force inhibiting the rational response of desertion was loyalty to one\u2019s fellow soldiers, virtually all of whom were other white males.

I will respond to your responses though. \n\n\n&gt; People's perception of their government is affected by the government's actions. Historically speaking (in America), you are not wrong that minorities have reason to distrust the government. However, where my view differs from yours is here: The government's actions and treatment of minorities throughout history, not ethnic diversity itself, has created a precedence of fear and distrust among ethnic groups. The situation of the black man in America is the most notable one today, built upon years of government-enabled slavery and discrimination. The internment of the Japanese, the discrimination against Chinese railroad workers, intolerance of Irish and Italian immigrants, even the Vietnam War. All of these things exacerbated the state of these minorities in America and created the very distrust you mention, as they were either allowed or mandated by the government.\n\nI agree with what you are saying. My claim is that ethnic diversity will lead to the government mistreating minorities. I'm not saying this is moral or anything, it is just the reality of life if you look at history and studies. The empirical evidence is there, if you want to argue against it, please be my guest. \n\n\n&gt; Think about it from the perspective of an ethnic minority member. If you distrust the government because it enables people to discriminate against you and your kind, then exactly what incentive would you have to participate in a system that would screw you over anyway? Keep in mind, for a long time it was intentionally difficult (as a result of discrimination) and even dangerous for ethnic minorities to even consider becoming politically active. Things like reading tests and poll taxes were designed to keep minorities, especially blacks, out of the legislature. And if people saw you anywhere close to a voting booth, they'd kill you. Basically, you're already struggling to survive. Why risk your life attempting something that's impossibly difficult and essentially fatal, even if it's for the \"greater good\"?\nThings are different now, you might say. I'd argue otherwise, since racism is still very much a strong, pervasive entity in America. But as you might be able to tell, that precedent has been built up, that mentality of \"my vote doesn't matter\" further strengthened by an ethnically-based distrust in the government. So, ethnic diversity did not cause low voter turnouts among minorities. Same as the first point, the precedent of fear and distrust of the government still runs strong through the hearts of minorities.\n\n\nAgain, ethnic diversity --&gt; More mistreatment by the government because government and people are inherently corrupt --&gt; Less trust in vote. \n\n\nWhat is wrong with the logic there? The mistreatment of minorities is caused when the minorities gain more numbers will lead to the government mistreating them. This isn't right or moral at all. But the evidence is there. Again, if you would like to discredit the studies he refers to, please do so.\n\n&gt; I'm a bit stumped as to what you mean by this. The only elaboration you provide is \"less likelihood of working on a community project\", but you'll need to do a better job of explaining this point. With all the other points you raise, I point to other causes, but with this one in particular I actually disagree with it. If you drive through the suburbs of San Francisco, particularly the middle/lower-middle class ones (like Mission District), you'll find countless murals depicting the community and unity, all done by the members of the community themselves. Going to Chinatown, there's the annual Chinese New Year parade and celebration that the entire community contributes to and participates in. I could list more examples, but my point is that culture is a strong unifier. That's why you have Chinatowns, Koreatowns, Little Italies. All those things that are glaring examples of communities centered around an ethnic culture. I'd argue that ethnic diversity intensifies community, because it creates a context where ethnic groups naturally band together in solidarity, because each one is surrounded by other groups with which they are unfamiliar.\n\nAnecdotal experiences don't suffice as evidence. I could easily just bring up Chicago or Barrio Logan in San Diego(that is where I am from). \n\n\n&gt; If what you are referring to is the specific decline experienced by the black community, with high rates of crime and incarceration, then what you're asking is why black people are in the state that they are in. That is a question much too complex to answer within the context of this response, but what I can give you is that ethnic diversity is not the reason. There state was predicated upon centuries of enslavement and disintegration from society. \n\nAgain, ethnic diversity is a reason, not the reason. Why is this so hard to comprehend? \n\n\n&gt; That kind of discrimination was perpetrated and facilitated by white people. That's why there are no accounts of Chinese people (for example) lynching blacks, or fleeing on a massive scale out of urban centers because of black people, or vice versa. (Throughout history they basically avoided each other, but that's beside the point) And yes, I know that the line between ethnicity and race is being blurred here, but it is necessary when discussing the plight of black people in America. But at any rate, as I have said before, ethnic diversity did not cause the destabilization of the black community. Racism and discrimination (again, I'm generalizing a lot here) did.\n\n\nThis is a stupid comparison. Chinese people were never a majority in a country with a significant minority of blacks. A more apt comparison would be to compare how the Chinese treat the Koreans and Japanese. If you look it up, they definitely discriminate. Chinese hate the Japanese, Japanese hate the Chinese etc. etc. \n\n\n&gt; Ties in directly to the previous point. Ethnic diversity is not the cause of this. Example: white people refused to sell houses to black people, disallowing them from building generational wealth, which we know is the most important factor to move up in society and to create lasting wealth. Without generational wealth, black people could not move out of the declining inner cities,(since white people took the job prospects and prosperity with them) creating the situation you see today. Do you think this would have been any different if black people were the only ethnic minorities that lived in America at that time in the 20th century?\n\nAgain, you are missing the point. Ethnic diversity leads to the majority (white people) being more distrustful and racist. That is just how the world works. Again, you are just combating the actual facts and data with your experiences. You are arguing against a strawman. I never said ethnic diversity is the main reason, I said it is a reason.\n\n\n\nAgain, more ethnic diversity --&gt; More affinity for the majority to discriminate --&gt; the consequences I listed. \n\n\n&gt; As I said, much of what we see today rides on what was already happening many decades ago. The phenomena you cite is not a direct result of ethnic diversity, but rather a result of America's (or rather white people's) response to ethnic diversity, that which we call racism.\n\n\nIt's not just Americans. But you just encapsulated my point. People respond to ethnic diversity with racism. It happens all over the world. Look around. That is the whole point of this CMV. \n\n\n&gt; Given the nature of your post, I am curious. What is your solution to the problems facing ethnic minorities? Should we take away ethnic diversity? That's impossible without deporting and killing every non-white in America. Then you'd have a homogeneous society, right? Nope, ethnicities still exist. Oh well.\n\n\nYou really put a lot of words into my mouth haha. I think we should be slightly more strict on immigration from an American viewpoint but that it's it. I don't think we should fight ethnic diversity, nor should we purge/deport people. I surely don't support building a wall. \n\n\n&gt; Given how low-effort this CMV is, I really question why you even posted it in the first place. I think I know why, but what the hell.\n\n\n....You completely argued against a strawman and called my comment low level? Don't you find that ironic?

To that end, all I can say is that communities can form along lines other than ethnicity.\n\nLook, I'm sorry, I *have* to take a break to address this. Your CMV is one of *the fucking worst* that I've ever seen. Seriously, you Ctrl+C'ed &amp; V'ed an article and only linked to the other one, like it's my job to fact-check you and to read your shit. (At least have the courtesy to copy-paste both?!)

But if it is what I think you're referring to, then my last two discussions of community and the decline of it should suffice in explaining why ethnic diversity is not the cause of it.\n\nAlright, so as I said in the beginning, most of your points, especially low trust in government, low voter turnout, and low community cohesion, are very complicated issues that have many different causes. It's almost laughable to suggest that ethnic diversity is the sole cause of distrust in the government, or any of those other things. And regarding low voter turnout, besides what I have already highlighted, you'll find low voter turnout along the lines of age more readily than ethnicity. 18-25 year olds have the lowest rate regardless of their ethnicities.\n\nAs I said, much of what we see today rides on what was already happening many decades ago.

All those things that are glaring examples of communities centered around an ethnic culture. I&amp;#39;d argue that ethnic diversity intensifies community, because it creates a context where ethnic groups naturally band together in solidarity, because each one is surrounded by other groups with which they are unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Upon re-reading your post, perhaps what you were referring to was ethnic diversity in a community as opposed to an entire society. To that end, all I can say is that communities can form along lines other than ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look, I&amp;#39;m sorry, I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to take a break to address this. Your CMV is one of &lt;em&gt;the fucking worst&lt;/em&gt; that I&amp;#39;ve ever seen. Seriously, you Ctrl+C&amp;#39;ed &amp;amp; V&amp;#39;ed an article and only linked to the other one, like it&amp;#39;s my job to fact-check you and to read your shit. (At least have the courtesy to copy-paste both?!) The particular problem I face here is that the first one discusses ethnic diversity in communities, whereas the second one (emulating your laziness, I just read the URL) discusses ethnic diversity in societies. Those are two &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different things that you didn&amp;#39;t even have the time to differentiate between. Whatever, let&amp;#39;s move on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If what you are referring to is the specific decline experienced by the black community, with high rates of crime and incarceration, then what you&amp;#39;re asking is why black people are in the state that they are in. That is a question much too complex to answer within the context of this response, but what I can give you is that ethnic diversity is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the reason. There state was predicated upon centuries of enslavement and disintegration from society. That kind of discrimination was perpetrated and facilitated by white people. That&amp;#39;s why there are no accounts of Chinese people (for example) lynching blacks, or fleeing on a massive scale out of urban centers because of black people, or vice versa. (Throughout history they basically avoided each other, but that&amp;#39;s beside the point) And yes, I know that the line between ethnicity and race is being blurred here, but it is necessary when discussing the plight of black people in America. But at any rate, as I have said before, ethnic diversity did not cause the destabilization of the black community. Racism and discrimination (again, I&amp;#39;m generalizing a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; here) did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lower perceived standard of living&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ties in directly to the previous point. Ethnic diversity is not the cause of this. Example: white people refused to sell houses to black people, disallowing them from building generational wealth, which we know is the most important factor to move up in society and to create lasting wealth. Without generational wealth, black people could not move out of the declining inner cities,(since white people took the job prospects and prosperity with them) creating the situation you see today. Do you think this would have been any different if black people were the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; ethnic minorities that lived in America at that time in the 20th century?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Less cooperation&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one is too vague for me to understand what exactly it is that you&amp;#39;re asking. But if it is what I think you&amp;#39;re referring to, then my last two discussions of community and the decline of it should suffice in explaining why ethnic diversity is not the cause of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alright, so as I said in the beginning, most of your points, especially low trust in government, low voter turnout, and low community cohesion, are very complicated issues that have many different causes. It&amp;#39;s almost laughable to suggest that ethnic diversity is the sole cause of distrust in the government, or any of those other things. And regarding low voter turnout, besides what I have already highlighted, you&amp;#39;ll find low voter turnout along the lines of age more readily than ethnicity. 18-25 year olds have the lowest rate regardless of their ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I said, much of what we see today rides on what was already happening many decades ago. The phenomena you cite is not a direct result of ethnic diversity, but rather a result of America&amp;#39;s (or rather white people&amp;#39;s) &lt;em&gt;response&lt;/em&gt; to ethnic diversity, that which we call racism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given the nature of your post, I am curious. What is &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; solution to the problems facing ethnic minorities? Should we take away ethnic diversity? That&amp;#39;s impossible without deporting and killing every non-white in America. Then you&amp;#39;d have a homogeneous society, right? Nope, ethnicities still exist. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given how low-effort this CMV is, I really question why you even posted it in the first place. I think I know why, but what the hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc2fzfa", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5mag1e/cmv_ethnic_diversity_leads_to_lower_trust_in/dc2fzfa/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483713937.0, "author_flair_text": "5\u2206", "created_utc": 1483685137.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mag1e", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mag1e", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 5, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mag1e", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc3aph4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "poloport", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc375kj", "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "What?\n\nSingapore is [well above average in trust in government according to this](http://www.edelman.com/post/trust-in-singapore-2014-edelman-trust-barometer/)\n\n[They're also a higly developed country with a good standard of living](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index)\n\nAnd [a voter turnout last election of 93%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Singapore#2015_general_election_results)\n\n\nSure they may be \"less emotional\" than others, whatever that means.

I have neither the time nor the responsibility to investigate the rest of your sources, but you're by all means encouraged to do so.\n\nHowever, even if the rest of your sources absolutely do show a negative correlation there's still a **huge** problem with your claim. For ethnic diversity to be correlated with all of those lower statistics, we need to say what they're lower *than*. \n\nIf we're comparing ethnically diverse groups to a population average, then any existing differences between ethnic groups will cause diversity to be correlated with differences between group and population statistics. Let's look at a toy example to demonstrate.\n\nSuppose there are two ethnic groups in our population, A and B, where 80% of the population belongs to group A. Further, suppose Group A has some arbitrary standard of living *x* and group B's standard of living is 50% of A's. This will give us a standard of living for the population of 0.9*x*.\n\nHowever,  [diversity indices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index), which I'm willing to bet are how most of your sources measure diversity, don't take population demographics into account at all.\n\nSo let's make a very ethnically diverse group, C, with 50% of its members from A and 50% of its members from B and compare them to the population average. Let's also assume that diversity by itself has *no effect*, and the members of A and B in group C simply reflect the averages for their respective ethnicities.\n\nNevertheless - huge surprise - we'll find that group C's standard of living is only 75% of Group A's. That's 15% lower than the population average! Diversity in itself didn't *lead to* that change, though, since members of C are no better off than other members of their ethnicity. The difference is entirely explained by the differences between groups in the larger population.\n\nFor a real world case study whites, blacks, and hispanics in the US make up about 64%, 12%, and 16% of the population. The percentage of those groups registered to vote, meanwhile, is about 73%, 70%, and 60%. So if we pick a random member from one of those groups, there's about a 70% chance that they're registered to vote.\n\nWithout any adjustments for the causative powers of ethnic diversity that you claim, though, a maximally diverse group only comes in at 68%. Diversity will be correlated with a difference from the population average solely because of existing differences in the population and not because ethnic diversity \"leads to\" any effects by itself.\n\nSo if you're worried about the negative effects of increasing ethnic diversity, it seems to me that the best answer is to address systemic inequalities between different ethnicities.", "edited": 1483723113.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your view depends on the sources you - or rather your block quotation - have cited, you may want to simply read them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we look at your first point, for example...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Across workgroups in the United States, as well as in Europe, internal heterogeneity (in terms of age, professional background, ethnicity, tenure and other factors) is generally associated with lower group cohesion, lower satisfaction and higher turnover (Jackson et al. 1991; Cohen &amp;amp; Bailey 1997; Keller 2001; Webber &amp;amp; Donahue 2001).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From Cohen &amp;amp; Bailey 1997&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Only two studies examined diversity; both studies conceptualized it in terms of knowledge and skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the abstract of Webber &amp;amp; Donahue&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Results showed that neither type  of diversity [highly-job related or less job related] had a relationship with cohesion or performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keller 2001 is looking at what he defines as &lt;em&gt;functional diversity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cross-functional groups consist of members from different functional areas, such as various research disciplines, engineering, manufacturing, or marketing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the abstract of Jackson et al. 1991&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interpersonal context was operationalized as personal dissimilarity and group heterogeneity with respect to age, tenure, education level, curriculum, alma mater, military service, and career experiences&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three of these sources have nothing to do with ethnic diversity and the fourth would appear to find little or no relationship, so Putnam&amp;#39;s inclusion of ethnicity among other factors that may be correlated with lower performance and cohesion seems suspect.

Let&amp;#39;s also assume that diversity by itself has &lt;em&gt;no effect&lt;/em&gt;, and the members of A and B in group C simply reflect the averages for their respective ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless - huge surprise - we&amp;#39;ll find that group C&amp;#39;s standard of living is only 75% of Group A&amp;#39;s. That&amp;#39;s 15% lower than the population average! Diversity in itself didn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;lead to&lt;/em&gt; that change, though, since members of C are no better off than other members of their ethnicity. The difference is entirely explained by the differences between groups in the larger population.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a real world case study whites, blacks, and hispanics in the US make up about 64%, 12%, and 16% of the population. The percentage of those groups registered to vote, meanwhile, is about 73%, 70%, and 60%. So if we pick a random member from one of those groups, there&amp;#39;s about a 70% chance that they&amp;#39;re registered to vote.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without any adjustments for the causative powers of ethnic diversity that you claim, though, a maximally diverse group only comes in at 68%. Diversity will be correlated with a difference from the population average solely because of existing differences in the population and not because ethnic diversity &amp;quot;leads to&amp;quot; any effects by itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re worried about the negative effects of increasing ethnic diversity, it seems to me that the best answer is to address systemic inequalities between different ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc2x1mr", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5mag1e/cmv_ethnic_diversity_leads_to_lower_trust_in/dc2x1mr/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483749429.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483720629.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 5, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mag1e", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mag1e", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 8, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mag1e", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mag1e", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc31lq6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "badoosh123", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc2l6zn", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "That really isn't an argument.

There likely exist other ethnicities that do not mix well together, as well, but I can only speak about what the presence of African-Americans tends to do to communities in the US.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe white people (those of European descent) and Asians, including Indians, co-exist pretty well, generally speaking, as well as both these groups with Native Americans and Latinos.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc582ov", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5mag1e/cmv_ethnic_diversity_leads_to_lower_trust_in/dc582ov/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483876715.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483847915.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}]
