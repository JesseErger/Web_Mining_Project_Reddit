[Here's a study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/oby.2004.95/full) that showed that a group doing exercise without trying to lose weight ended up losing about as much body fat as another group that tried to lose weight via diet. \"The reduction in total and abdominal fat within the diet weight loss and exercise without weight loss groups was greater than within controls (p &lt; 0.001) but not different from each other (p &gt; 0.05).\" Part of my view is that the the obsession with weight as a measure is unhealthy as it causes people to discount results like these: \"Daily exercise without caloric restriction was associated with substantial reductions in total fat, abdominal fat, visceral fat, and insulin resistance in women. Exercise without weight loss was also associated with a substantial reduction in total and abdominal obesity.\"\nThese results are that exercise, *even without weight loss*, is effective at reducing obesity.

Exercise without weight loss was also associated with a substantial reduction in total and abdominal obesity.&amp;quot;\nThese results are that exercise, &lt;em&gt;even without weight loss&lt;/em&gt;, is effective at reducing obesity.

[Here's a study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/oby.2004.95/full) that showed that a group doing exercise without trying to lose weight ended up losing about as much body fat as another group that tried to lose weight via diet. \"The reduction in total and abdominal fat within the diet weight loss and exercise without weight loss groups was greater than within controls (p &lt; 0.001) but not different from each other (p &gt; 0.05).\" Part of my view is that the the obsession with weight as a measure is unhealthy as it causes people to discount results like these: \"Daily exercise without caloric restriction was associated with substantial reductions in total fat, abdominal fat, visceral fat, and insulin resistance in women. Exercise without weight loss was also associated with a substantial reduction in total and abdominal obesity.\" These results are that exercise, even without weight loss, is effective at reducing obesity. However, Vox would throw this away as it doesn't cause weight loss, and thus you should think about dieting more. \n\nBut wait, this study literally showed that exercise without caloric restriction reduced body fat by **as much** as dieting. Given this, what makes dieting better?

Exercise without weight loss was also associated with a substantial reduction in total and abdominal obesity.&amp;quot; These results are that exercise, even without weight loss, is effective at reducing obesity.
