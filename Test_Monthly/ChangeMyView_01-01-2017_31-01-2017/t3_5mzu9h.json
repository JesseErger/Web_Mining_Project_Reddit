Their actions, even when not directly affecting you, matter to how you view them.\n\nCheating is morally reprehensible, while threesomes are not. But they share a commonality in how I would react.

I don&amp;#39;t think there is anything narcissistic about having prefrences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For someone who has done &amp;quot;a lot of thought,&amp;quot; you&amp;#39;ve done no explaining as to why it&amp;#39;s important. Saying &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s important to me so I care&amp;quot; is curricular.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no deep, logical reason for it if that is what you are looking for. I care because throughout my upbringing I picked up certain romantic views of sex. And while I realize there is nothing wrong with sexual acts so long as all parties consent, it still doesn&amp;#39;t sit well with me. So while I don&amp;#39;t look down on people who do such things, I don&amp;#39;t want them in my romantic life because on a basic, primal level the whole thing doesn&amp;#39;t sit well with me. There just isn&amp;#39;t much more to it. And cherishing values that you were brought up with isn&amp;#39;t bad so long as they aren&amp;#39;t harming others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So your partner is supposed to be grooming their whole life to conform to your arbitrary standards&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They should largely naturally conform to my standards (some logic based, some emotion based, none arbitrary) and be willing to accommodate smaller standards. That&amp;#39;s how relationships work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;or else it&amp;#39;s the same as then actively violating your trust in a way they know will hurt you? Maybe this was supposed to be hyperbole but it&amp;#39;s an unbelievably stupid comparsion. Them not matching your silly standard is somehow the same as then betraying your trust and actively hurting you?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, I&amp;#39;m not saying those two cases are equivalent. I&amp;#39;m saying that more goes into a relationship than how a person interacts with you. Just because you were enjoying their company doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s illogical to have your perception of them change. Their actions, even when not directly affecting you, matter to how you view them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheating is morally reprehensible, while threesomes are not. But they share a commonality in how I would react.

I think a person can end a relationship or decline to start a relationship with another person for any reason.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that we can't be critical of the reasons people give for ending or not starting a relationship. Is it reasonable? Is it based on a fair judgment? What do a person's expectations of a partner say about them? \n\nSurely you can think of situations where, while a person has every right to break up with their partner (because no one is entitled to a relationship with another person), their reasons for doing so are deserving of criticism?  For example, if your partner broke up with you because you went out with your platonic friends once a week----most people would be critical of that person as being too controlling; it's unreasonable to expect your partner to not spend time with their friends. \n\nIn the same way, I think it's fine to be critical of people's reasons for breaking up with or not dating people based on their sexual history. The expectations people have for their partner(s) can be unreasonable and/or unhealthy. Or sometimes people make unfair assumptions/generalizations about people. Sometimes people's expectations of their partner(s) are hypocritical. Sometimes people project their own insecurities on other people instead of taking responsibility for their own issues. \n\nAlso, I disagree that slut-shaming has to have a malicious intent. If a man says, \"I would never have sex with a woman who has had casual sex before because (she's probably a cheater, she's dirty/immoral, she wouldn't be able to form a real bond, she probably has an STD, etc.)\", he's reinforcing negative and unfair stereotypes about promiscuous people, and I consider that to be harmful even if you don't have a malicious intent. \n\nIf, on the other hand, a person says, \"My religion teaches that you should only have sex within the context of marriage. I'm saving sex for marriage and I want a partner who is doing the same\", I don't take much issue with that.\n\n&gt;Also, this preference can come from insecurity but it doesn't necessarily. It could come from religious values, moral values, or general views on sex.\n\nYes, and religious values, moral values, and general views on sex are allowed to be disagreed with and debated. \n\nIf I criticize someone for their expectations for their partner(s), I'm not saying they don't have a right to those expectations, I'm instead trying to challenge them on their expectations or the views that their expectations are built on.

(of course assuming that your agree that slut shaming is bad)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc8vrxp", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5mzu9h/cmv_breaking_up_with_someone_or_refusing_to_date/dc8vrxp/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1484094814.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1484066014.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mzu9h", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc8vp15", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "R_V_Z", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5mzu9h", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "There is no unacceptable reason for breaking up with somebody because it is unacceptable to force people to remain together if one party doesn't wish to be in the relationship.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no unacceptable reason for breaking up with somebody because it is unacceptable to force people to remain together if one party doesn&amp;#39;t wish to be in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc8vp15", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5mzu9h/cmv_breaking_up_with_someone_or_refusing_to_date/dc8vp15/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1484094720.0, "author_flair_text": "1\u2206", "created_utc": 1484065920.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mzu9h", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mzu9h", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc84pz3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "etquod", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc83440", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Sorry TessSteckles, your comment has been removed: \n\n&gt; Comment Rule 1\\. \"Direct responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OP\u2019s current view (however minor), unless they are asking a clarifying question.
