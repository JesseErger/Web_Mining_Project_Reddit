Now I don&amp;#39;t believe that these players were cheating and also don&amp;#39;t think that they should be permabanned either; BUT that being said, those players that were doing this were gigantic trolls and just douches in general. I just don&amp;#39;t think that cheating is the right word for it, I think that &amp;quot;griefing&amp;quot; would be a more appropriate term for it. Which IMO they should still get punished for this, such as a ban for a couple days/weeks or something along those lines, just not permabanned for &amp;quot;cheating&amp;quot;. Also a side note, there were doing this exploit in a 3v3 arcade &amp;quot;just for fun&amp;quot; mode and not in competitive matches.

My friend said 'report them for cheating', and I made the argument that although it's pretty douchey, it's not really cheating.  But I've reconsidered that position, when thinking about what it means to cheat.\n\nTo my mind, 'to cheat' is to either:\n\n1. do something unfair\n\n2. do something that is outside the rules of the game\n\nClearly, the Mei glitch isn't unfair.  Both teams are able to do the same glitch.  \n\nSo then, I wonder, is going through the roof 'outside the rules of the game'?  Maybe.  \nYou could make the argument that no, it is not cheating.  The primary rules in a video game are ***explicit***, and for Overwatch, you must eliminate your opponents using the tools at your disposal.  \nIf the video game developer accidentally leaves a bit of code in the game that says \"if a player spins in a circle twice, they get double hit points\", is that cheating?  If the video game developer accidentally leaves a roof/wall texture that allows people to pass through it, is that cheating?  Maybe not.  As a player, it's not my fault that the map was built defectively.\n\nOn the other hand, there are very obvious ***implicit*** rules with video games, which we know by using common sense.  The game is played on a map with rooms, stairs, outdoors, etc. with very obvious \"in play\" and \"not in play\" areas.  Using our common sense, we can see that rendering yourself undamageable while still being able to attack enemies is not really within the spirit of the game.\n\n---\n\nRegardless of whether we can agree that it's cheating or not, I think it should be incumbent upon Blizzard to either fix their maps or inform players that \"using Mei's wall to go into the roof is considered cheating\", before banning anyone who used that exploit.\n\nP.S. I don't think it matters in the slightest whether it's a competitive or 'just for fun' game mode.\n\nP.P.S. You're not entirely right about speedrunning. There are different speedrun categories.  Some categories allow any glitches, bugs, etc.  But other categories are \"noglitch\", and require the game to be played in the 'conventional' way - all exploits are considered cheating.\n\n---\n***TL;DR*** Whether or not something is cheating depends on what you consider the \"rules\" of the game.  When it comes to video games, there tends not to be any explicitly-laid-out rules, so we're left using our intuition/common sense.  \n\nIt's the kind of exploit that could very plausibly happen accidentally, so banning players because of Blizzard's poor map design is a bad precedent.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a week ago, I was playing a 3v3 game with two friends.

The primary rules in a video game are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;explicit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and for Overwatch, you must eliminate your opponents using the tools at your disposal.&lt;br/&gt;\nIf the video game developer accidentally leaves a bit of code in the game that says &amp;quot;if a player spins in a circle twice, they get double hit points&amp;quot;, is that cheating?  If the video game developer accidentally leaves a roof/wall texture that allows people to pass through it, is that cheating?  Maybe not.  As a player, it&amp;#39;s not my fault that the map was built defectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are very obvious &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;implicit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; rules with video games, which we know by using common sense.  The game is played on a map with rooms, stairs, outdoors, etc. with very obvious &amp;quot;in play&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;not in play&amp;quot; areas.  Using our common sense, we can see that rendering yourself undamageable while still being able to attack enemies is not really within the spirit of the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether we can agree that it&amp;#39;s cheating or not, I think it should be incumbent upon Blizzard to either fix their maps or inform players that &amp;quot;using Mei&amp;#39;s wall to go into the roof is considered cheating&amp;quot;, before banning anyone who used that exploit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. I don&amp;#39;t think it matters in the slightest whether it&amp;#39;s a competitive or &amp;#39;just for fun&amp;#39; game mode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.P.S. You&amp;#39;re not entirely right about speedrunning. There are different speedrun categories.  Some categories allow any glitches, bugs, etc.  But other categories are &amp;quot;noglitch&amp;quot;, and require the game to be played in the &amp;#39;conventional&amp;#39; way - all exploits are considered cheating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Whether or not something is cheating depends on what you consider the &amp;quot;rules&amp;quot; of the game.  When it comes to video games, there tends not to be any explicitly-laid-out rules, so we&amp;#39;re left using our intuition/common sense.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the kind of exploit that could very plausibly happen accidentally, so banning players because of Blizzard&amp;#39;s poor map design is a bad precedent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc2ebeg", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5mbosy/cmvexploiting_a_bugglitch_in_a_video_game_is_not/dc2ebeg/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483710687.0, "author_flair_text": "19\u2206", "created_utc": 1483681887.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 4, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mbosy", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mbosy", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mbosy", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mbosy", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mbosy", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc2hrel", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Jaysank", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc2h595", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "But, to refer back to the SSBB example, Meta Knight's glitch was never officially acknowledged by Nintendo as an exploit.
