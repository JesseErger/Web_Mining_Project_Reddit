I think that you may not be receiving the right information from the media. It's my first time in this subreddit so let's try to work together :). \n\nThe point of view coming from more conservative people, I think, can shine light on this topic. Taking in account that;\n\n* It is very different that someone killed someone because they hate what they stand for\n* Than to shoot someone because you are mentally stable, possibly even a consequence of what this person did to defend the same people he shot (I'm talking PTSD).\n\nSo of course people are going to talk more about the \"foreigner\" that shot us because he doesn't like us than the \"comrade\" that shot us because we couldn't effectively help him return sane home. The second is a thing of shame, but also, the first is a system where people are taught to hate us, we are compelled to do something.\n\n(I use 'us' as in western civ, as I am not american)\n\nSecond;\n\n* It is very different an attack A \"protesting against the government\" where the shooter acted alone, as in not part of an organization. Meaning that when you capture the shooter you dont need to  deal with more trying to do the same with the same motivation\n* Than to deal with a member of an organization that continuously bomb, explode and assault people part of western civ.\n\nIn other words: There is no point in continuously spending energy reporting on a single case, because when it's over, it's done. We report organized crime and violence constantly because we need to do something against it, if we don't, I'll keep affecting us.\n\n----\n\nOn another note, here's a video of a skeptic that I really advise you to watch. He presents a lot of points that says why there is no \"bias\" against muslims. 99.6% of terror attacks and suicide bombings are made by muslims. A bias would mean that we disproportionately report muslims over say, christian terrorists.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XZZ3SypO1U&amp;t=221s\n\nEdit: Sargon of Akkad has some strong opinions.
