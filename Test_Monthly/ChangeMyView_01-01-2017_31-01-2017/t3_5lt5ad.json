The compensation you get (hypothetically) now for that position that you made a significant investment in was adequate for you, was it not? If not, then working to change that in your own situation is what you should do, is it not?\n\nWhat I'm asking is why the compensation you theoretically are getting now for your skilled labor for which you made a significant investment that you were happy with you are suddenly not happy with simply because someone else is getting better compensation than they were before at *their* job?\n\n&gt;If the minimum wage is raised to 15 an hour, I'm not being compensated accordingly.\n\nWhy not? If you're being compensated accordingly at 17 an hour for your investment/skill and you are happy with that compensation, why does that suddenly change because someone else is getting slightly more for what *they* do than they were before?\n\n&gt;Because someone who didn't make the same investment as I did, is now reaping the same desired outcome while I am effectively operating at a lower rate than they are, when you consider student loan debts. \n\nJust because someone's investment was different doesn't mean it wasn't 'equal' to what you did.\n\nTake me and my sister. My older sister has a master's degree that she worked very hard for. She has massive student loan debt. She's an elementary school teacher, a job she loves but gets paid freak-all for.\n\nI have very little college experience. I took a few classes but couldn't afford to continue to go and refused to put myself under mountains of debt. Instead, I worked my way up from a minimum wage entrance level job to a now fourteen year career that I love. I make literally three times what my sister makes.\n\nMy investment was different than hers, mine wasn't grinding through college and getting into debt, but so what? My sister is not being compensated properly but that has nothing to do with the fact that she went to college and I didn't but to the fact that the job field she chose to go into hasn't been compensated accordingly for years. \n\nJust because someone doesn't follow the exact same path as you do and doesn't have mounding student loan debts doesn't mean that it's only fair that they get less money than you do at what they do. By that logic I should be making less than my sister and it's unfair that I make more than she did and that if I suddenly got my pay cut down to below hers that would make things 'fair'. Instead, she should do what she does right now- advocate for higher wages for teachers because they are woefully underpaid for their services, not because she feels she must make more money than someone else who didn't go to college just because she went to college.\n\n&gt;If not, then why would I ever bother paying to learn a skill?\n\nPlenty of people learn skills- and even pay to learn skills- for reasons other than just to 'make more money than someone else'. My sister knew teachers got stiffed horribly in the pay department and that she'd have tons of student debt if she went in to become a teacher- *she did it anyway.* Why? Because she loves it, it's what she wanted to do, and her requirement for being happy and feeling she's doing well isn't that other people are miserable and doing worse than she is.\n\nAgain, if you're doing what you love to do and you're making enough money to be comfortable, pay your bills, and even have some luxuries, how does it hurt you *at all* if someone else can do the same?\n\nIf you're not happy with the compensation you're getting for your skills, work to change *that*, don't work to make other people worse off so you artificially feel better by comparison.\n\n&gt;If the government is just giving out money-\n\nYou really think that someone who works at *anything* for forty-sixty hours a week is being just 'given money' if they can afford to put food on their table, gas in their car, a roof over their head, and occasionally splurge on a luxury in return for doing so?\n\n&gt;Will they repay my school costs-?\n\nWhy should they? Should I repay your school costs because I had the audacity to make a decent living at a good job without going to school first? \n\n&gt;Since me and Joe Shcmoe are making roughly the same amount?\n\nAgain, how is Joe Schmoe making roughly the same amount and being able to feed his family harmful to *you*? It doesn't hinder you or hurt you in the slightest. Why does Joe Schmoe have to struggle endlessly to try and feed himself and his kids in order for you to feel ok about you and your ability to feed yourself and your family?\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I expect to be compensated accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you are.

My older sister has a master&amp;#39;s degree that she worked very hard for. She has massive student loan debt. She&amp;#39;s an elementary school teacher, a job she loves but gets paid freak-all for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have very little college experience. I took a few classes but couldn&amp;#39;t afford to continue to go and refused to put myself under mountains of debt. Instead, I worked my way up from a minimum wage entrance level job to a now fourteen year career that I love. I make literally three times what my sister makes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My investment was different than hers, mine wasn&amp;#39;t grinding through college and getting into debt, but so what? My sister is not being compensated properly but that has nothing to do with the fact that she went to college and I didn&amp;#39;t but to the fact that the job field she chose to go into hasn&amp;#39;t been compensated accordingly for years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just because someone doesn&amp;#39;t follow the exact same path as you do and doesn&amp;#39;t have mounding student loan debts doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it&amp;#39;s only fair that they get less money than you do at what they do. By that logic I should be making less than my sister and it&amp;#39;s unfair that I make more than she did and that if I suddenly got my pay cut down to below hers that would make things &amp;#39;fair&amp;#39;. Instead, she should do what she does right now- advocate for higher wages for teachers because they are woefully underpaid for their services, not because she feels she must make more money than someone else who didn&amp;#39;t go to college just because she went to college.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If not, then why would I ever bother paying to learn a skill?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people learn skills- and even pay to learn skills- for reasons other than just to &amp;#39;make more money than someone else&amp;#39;. My sister knew teachers got stiffed horribly in the pay department and that she&amp;#39;d have tons of student debt if she went in to become a teacher- &lt;em&gt;she did it anyway.&lt;/em&gt; Why? Because she loves it, it&amp;#39;s what she wanted to do, and her requirement for being happy and feeling she&amp;#39;s doing well isn&amp;#39;t that other people are miserable and doing worse than she is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, if you&amp;#39;re doing what you love to do and you&amp;#39;re making enough money to be comfortable, pay your bills, and even have some luxuries, how does it hurt you &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; if someone else can do the same?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re not happy with the compensation you&amp;#39;re getting for your skills, work to change &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, don&amp;#39;t work to make other people worse off so you artificially feel better by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If the government is just giving out money-&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You really think that someone who works at &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; for forty-sixty hours a week is being just &amp;#39;given money&amp;#39; if they can afford to put food on their table, gas in their car, a roof over their head, and occasionally splurge on a luxury in return for doing so?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Will they repay my school costs-?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why should they? Should I repay your school costs because I had the audacity to make a decent living at a good job without going to school first? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since me and Joe Shcmoe are making roughly the same amount?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, how is Joe Schmoe making roughly the same amount and being able to feed his family harmful to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;? It doesn&amp;#39;t hinder you or hurt you in the slightest. Why does Joe Schmoe have to struggle endlessly to try and feed himself and his kids in order for you to feel ok about you and your ability to feed yourself and your family?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbymiyg", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lt5ad/cmv_i_believe_that_increasing_the_minimum_wage/dbymiyg/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483509649.0, "author_flair_text": "31\u2206", "created_utc": 1483480849.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lt5ad", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbykzok", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "jchoyt", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dbykhpj", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "1) You're still doing better then they are and have an upside .... your wages will go higher over time, while and unskilled worker's won't (relative to inflation).\n\n2) The jump to $15 an hour would probably take a decade, during which time your wage would likely double as well.
