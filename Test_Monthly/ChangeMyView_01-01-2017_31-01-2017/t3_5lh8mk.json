After all, one of the arguments for self-driving cars is increased traffic efficiency, and one of the main reason it&amp;#39;d be achievable is that it&amp;#39;s possible for the onboard AIs to communicate between each other, to tell each other where they are going, to plan ahead of time to ensure that traffic efficiency.

Let&amp;#39;s be honest here, most people (in urban areas at least, it&amp;#39;s a different story if you live outside of a city) will not bother with paying for garage space, maintaining their own vehicle, and hauling empty space when it&amp;#39;s not needed, not when you can have a car suited to your needs just drive up to you in a few minutes and take you whenever you want. It would be cheap enough with no human driver to pay. It would still leave a payment trail behind, allowing the authority to track your movements way too easily.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Now, it&amp;#39;s a slippery slope argument, I&amp;#39;m aware of that. It perfectly fits the &amp;quot;A can lead to B, B is bad, therefore A has to be stopped.&amp;quot; A in this case is development of SDCs, B is the authority spying on you. To prevent it from being a &lt;em&gt;fallacious&lt;/em&gt; slippery slope argument, my argument needs proof that A not only &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; lead to B, but also that A will reasonably likely lead to B. And here&amp;#39;s the thing. If I understand the US politics correctly, there are American organs spying on the internet traffic, telecommunication, having backdoors in the systems of every ISP. And while I do not know how things look like in my country, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure Poland does do things like that too. Possibly for our closest ally, the US.

Of course, they had to use the informants they&amp;#39;ve blackmailed before to do that. I can&amp;#39;t imagine the sort of things they would pull of if they had more info with less (error-prone) humans needed to obtain it. And also, while one might have nothing to hide now, it&amp;#39;s impossible to know if what you haven&amp;#39;t hidden now won&amp;#39;t be used against you in the future.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t see any obvious flaws with the argument, but my gut feeling tells me it&amp;#39;s somewhat too simplistic, and so I don&amp;#39;t trust it entirely.
