Your view seems to basically suggest that a person's race, gender, orientation, or life circumstance shouldn't change the way you interact with them. If I'm correct, it seems like you want all of your encounters with other human beings to be treated as \"blank slates\" that remain ignorant of their race, sex, and so forth. You seem to suggest that this is a good way of treating them, because it ensures people get equal treatment independent of anything particular about them; you'd hold the door for everyone, after all, so why shouldn't you treat them all with the same courtesies and cautions?\n\n\nThe first problem with your view is that human beings are different, so treating them all the same fails to be tactful and respectful. You deny both their humanity and your own by refusing to treat them as the distinct entities they are.\n\n\nLet me explain what I mean. For starters, lets agree that human beings are different. This seems to be undeniable; some people believe in God, some don't, some people are homosexual, some aren't, some people are women, some aren't, and so on down the line. We come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and creeds, with our own backstories, opinions, and experiences. Given this, we have our own likes and dislikes, and our own neuroticisms and fears. Let's say, for example, that a certain woman doesn't like the door being held open for her because it makes her feel weak and objectified. Let's suspend judgment on whether or not her feelings are justified (though I believe they are) and solely concentrate on the fact that it makes her feel bad. It seems that the right thing to do would be to not hold the door open for her, yes? If we are looking purely at the way it makes her feel, and we understand that it is going to hurt her in some way, it seems that we shouldn't open the door for her because of her experience. Or take another example of a Vietnam Veteran who is suffering from PTSD because he accidentally shot one of his own men in battle. Let's say that, ordinarily, you deem it cool to throw surprise parties for people - most people like them and it's a pretty common thing to do in our society to make people feel loved and cared for. Would you throw a surprise party for the vet, just because that interaction would make sense *on the whole*? That doesn't really seem like the right thing to do. You are disrespecting his unique humanity, which is that of a Vietnam Veteran. Understanding what makes people different is necessary to fully respect them. Each interaction with a person should be handled on a case-by-case basis, personally catered to their needs and feelings. This isn't always possible, of course, but you should do the best you can to achieve this, just as you wouldn't talk about sports with your friend who never watches them. People aren't blank slates that can be treated the same way as any other, each one is different.\n\n\nThe second problem with your view is it assumes that the actions you apply to people are good as long as they are fair - this isn't true. Just because you hold the door open for everybody equally regardless of who they are doesn't mean the action of holding the door open itself is a good action. As an example, consider an indiscriminate murderer. This guy is equally likely to straight up cap anybody; regardless of their gender, nationality, or orientation. No matter who you are, no matter what your story, this guy is going to murder you. Does this mean his act of murder is OK, since it is fairly distributed among everybody? Of course not, murdering is bad. Since you are basing your interactions with others on things that *you believe are okay*, this means your morals are coming from within you subjectively and then applied to the world. No matter who is coming down the street, a white man, a black man, a criminal, the pope, you are going to approach with caution, you say. Great, but the *fairness itself* doesn't make your caution moral, any more than an indiscriminate murderer is doing the right thing by not being choosy with whom he kills.\n\n\nAnd besides, there are people you shouldn't hold the door open for. I don't know about you, but if the Aurora shooter was trying to get in that door, I wouldn't politely hold it with a grin on my face.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to try to get clear on your view before I respond to it.

If the squirrel is too cautious, it will be unable to eat.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re being overly alert and cautious of everyone you cross paths with (as per your example), you remind me of the too-cautious squirrel.&lt;br/&gt;\nIn a different situation, if you&amp;#39;re too accepting and chummy with everyone, you may find yourself being taken advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are probabilities with everything in life.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe probability of being attacked by a senior (60+ years old) is significantly lower than the probability of being attacked by a young person (18-30 years old).  As such, treating both groups as being equally dangerous means that you&amp;#39;re either being too brazen around young people, or too cautious around old people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same principle applies to anything you can generalize about people.  Race, age, sex, (apparent) wealth, size, gait, etc.&lt;br/&gt;\nFor each of these categories, there are some groups that ought to be shown more caution and some that ought to be shown less caution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc0dbh2", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5m1nmq/cmv_when_it_comes_to_how_i_interact_with_people/dc0dbh2/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483603606.0, "author_flair_text": "19\u2206", "created_utc": 1483574806.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m1nmq", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "name": "t1_dc1f509", "id": "dc1f509", "parent_id": "t1_dc0vmuv", "depth": 4, "children": ["dc1f509"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc0vmuv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DragomairAsura", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc04r4n", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "[deleted]  \n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.6373 \n &gt; 00582)", "edited": 1483795998.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;br/&gt;\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;00582)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc0vmuv", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5m1nmq/cmv_when_it_comes_to_how_i_interact_with_people/dc0vmuv/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483630404.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483601604.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc04r4n", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Reclaimer78", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc03txd", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I guess I wanted to see if others could change my view and convince me that it's ill-adviced to interact with all people ~~someone~~ the same.
