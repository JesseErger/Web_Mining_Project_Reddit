If you believe, as I do, that the causes of addiction are not&lt;/code&gt;scientific&amp;#39; issues, but primarily moral, or even philosophical ones, then why shoudn&amp;#39;t creative writers have an insight into addiction that is universally and permanently valid? Of course, I have innumerable C20th texts to draw upon. I have little interest in psychology either; the motivation of addicts does not seem to me to be complex enough to require their specific knowledge.

Whether it&amp;#39;s a nature thing or a nurture thing, we know that some people are more predisposed to addiction. My family has a pretty good history of not becoming addicted to things: my uncle was able to try pretty much every drug under the sun and quit them without much fanfare, and ditto my dad, and I already mentioned that I felt no desire to keep using opioids after the pain they treated was gone. But to assume that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; experiences reality the way that I do is just wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the difference between addicts and everybody else; they always want more. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, but that doesn&amp;#39;t preclude it being a disease.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You haven&amp;#39;t addressed several points thus far: If addiction isn&amp;#39;t a disease, how can quitting cold turkey cause literal death? If addiction isn&amp;#39;t a disease, how can people be driven to such irrational choices that are clearly self-destructive, unless there is some component that is overriding rational thought, a-la a disease? If addiction isn&amp;#39;t a disease, how do you explain that difference in brain scans?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of these are the main points and I&amp;#39;m requesting that they be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbyhizy", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5ltqvg/cmv_the_misguided_belief_that_addiction_is_a/dbyhizy/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483504220.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483475420.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5ltqvg", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbytoid", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Iswallowedafly", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dbyh01s", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Other people doctor shop or steal script pads or do other things to find their drugs. \n\nBecause if I go into a doc with a shoulder injury I can leave that injury addicted to opiates. \n\nThe addict was simply addicted. \n\nWe are talking about very powerful painkillers here.

The piece on the right is a drug.\n\nOur brain has many different kinds of receptors, and like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle, they have a unique shape that corresponds to a specific chemical.

Our body naturally makes these chemicals when we need to.\n\nMore specifically, the jigsaw puzzle piece on the left is a \u03bc-opioid receptor. It's unique shape is designed to fit to the chemical morphine, which is the jigsaw puzzle piece on the right. Morphine is created by your white-blood cells. When morphine attaches to a \u03bc-opioid receptor, it tells your brain to numb your pain and anxiety.\n\nWhen we take Heroin, it quickly breaks down into morphine in our blood stream, where it is taken to the brain. Suddenly, we have a huge source of morphine that our body didn't produce. Soon, all the \u03bc-opioid receptor are activated, and our brain is now being given false instructions from our body. Our body becomes *extremely* relaxed and *extremely* numb. The resulting euphoria is so satisfying that we are tempted to take the drug again. Soon, we end up using the drug all the time.\n\nNow our brain is being told that we are constantly anxious and constantly in pain, but it knows that isn't true. It assumes that something is wrong with our white blood cells. \"What used to be the regular amount of morphine is now an extremely low amount of morphine, and what used to be an extremely high amount of morphine is now the regular amount,\" your brain says. \"Therefore, I should increase the number of \u03bc-opioid receptors, so that I will treat what used to be an extremely high amount of morphine as the regular amount.\"\n\nThe problem is, your white blood cells are never informed of the change. They keep on producing the same amount of morphine as they always had, which is now not enough to tell your brain to keep your body feeling normal. As soon as you stop using heroine, your body will now assume that your white blood cells have stopped creating morphine, and your body will start becoming extremely anxious and in constant pain. Meanwhile, when you take heroine, your body feels completely normal, but you no longer feel any euphoria.\n\nTheoretically, you could stop here and be fine. Although the anxiety and pain would be uncomftorble, soon your brain would realize it's mistake, and start destroying all the extra  \u03bc-opioid receptors so that you can feel normal with your natural morphine levels. \n\nBut not everyone stops while they still can. Many people increase their dosage, so that they can feel the same euphoria they had when they took the drug the first time. Each time they increase the dosage, the brain gets more and more morphine, and each time, it builds more and more \u03bc-opioid receptors.

But physical dependency *does* take over if you abuse drugs long enough.\n\nWhen you initially take drugs, the biochemical reaction causes your brain to dump dopamine into your system. This is where the \"high\" comes from. But after time, once your body adjusts to the presence of the drug, the amount of dopamine released diminishes. Eventually, you need the drug just to get the *baseline* levels of dopamine into your system. This is what people mean when they say \"addiction.\" It's not about getting high, it's about feeling normal, because you have physically lost the ability to feel that way without drugs. This is a watered-down explanation, but it's a high-level view of what happens.\n\nThe same thing happens with caffeine. Ever been around someone who drinks coffee habitually but hasn't had their morning cup? I bet they're irritable. I know people who will physically get headaches if they don't have coffee. Their body has lost the ability to function properly without it.\n\nWhich brings me to my last point: withdrawal. If you don't think addiction changes body chemistry, then why does the body react so negatively to being cut off? Why do people need to be locked in rooms so they can't get access to drugs while going through withdrawal (or detoxing)? \n\nIf you want more information on the science of drug addiction you can find it [here](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/media-guide/science-drug-abuse-addiction-basics).", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: I haven&amp;#39;t read through all of these comments so I apologize if I&amp;#39;m repeating an argument.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for your CMV, I&amp;#39;m all for taking responsibility for your actions, which I think is the main driver behind your viewpoint. But physical dependency &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; take over if you abuse drugs long enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you initially take drugs, the biochemical reaction causes your brain to dump dopamine into your system. This is where the &amp;quot;high&amp;quot; comes from. But after time, once your body adjusts to the presence of the drug, the amount of dopamine released diminishes. Eventually, you need the drug just to get the &lt;em&gt;baseline&lt;/em&gt; levels of dopamine into your system. This is what people mean when they say &amp;quot;addiction.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s not about getting high, it&amp;#39;s about feeling normal, because you have physically lost the ability to feel that way without drugs. This is a watered-down explanation, but it&amp;#39;s a high-level view of what happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same thing happens with caffeine. Ever been around someone who drinks coffee habitually but hasn&amp;#39;t had their morning cup? I bet they&amp;#39;re irritable. I know people who will physically get headaches if they don&amp;#39;t have coffee. Their body has lost the ability to function properly without it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to my last point: withdrawal.
