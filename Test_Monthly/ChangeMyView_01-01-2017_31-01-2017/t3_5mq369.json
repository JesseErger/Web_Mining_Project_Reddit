[Sauce for everything I'm about to say](http://adc.bmj.com/content/90/8/853.full). First of all, the number of circumcisions needed to prevent one UTI is 111--and UTIs are easily curable with medication. So you are performing permanent surgeries on hundreds of boys, to prevent less than 1% of them from maybe having to take a pill? Now, also note that the rates of negative side effects (most commonly hemorrage and infection) are 2%-10%. That's right, you end up inflicting *more harm* on those boys than you are trying to prevent. The reason we use vaccines, which do occasionally kill children, is that they save far, far, far more than they hurt. But circumcision is hurting more than it is helping. You are inflicting more than twice as many minor ills (with the occasional serious one) as you're trying to prevent.\n\nThe penile cancer thing is also outdated. You can google for more, but right [here](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/penilecancer/detailedguide/penile-cancer-prevention) is a nice medical site pointing out that while a protective effect was shown, that effect disappeared once you corrected for other factors, like phimosis. It also points out that it would take 900 circumcisions to prevent one case of penile cancer, so again, you are hurting dramatically more boys than you are helping.\n\nBut, let's draw another example. Remember how Angelina Jolie got a mastectomy because she had the breast cancer gene? Should parents be able to remove their daughters' breast buds, and prevent her from developing breasts, just because it might lower her chances of cancer later? \n\nNow, the final argument is the STI one. And that one is, admittedly, a bit more complex. Yes, eliminating a mucous membrane does make it more difficult to catch certain STIs (since that's the protection circumcision offers--the glans and foreskin are supposed to be a mucous membrane, but lose that due to the calluses that form). The problem, though, is that circumcision doesn't offer complete protection against *any* STIs. So, you still need to teach the kids to wear condoms, and once the condom is on, there's no difference. Yes, there are studies that show a 60% decrease in HIV transmission after adult male circumcision--but that's still much much lower than the nearly-100% protection offered by condoms. It's also, again, a little ridiculous to compare areas that have an HIV epidemic with countries that do not. I'll again go to vaccines--we do not regularly vaccinate against malaria, unless someone is going to be at risk for malaria. In the US, for example, only about one third of one percent of the population has HIV, and most of them are homosexual (and circumcision is NOT shown to reduce risk of HIV transmission amongst men who sleep with men, only female-to-male transmission) so the likelihood that the infant boy will ever be sexually active with someone who has HIV is already incredibly unlikely. Risk, vs. reward.\n\nAnd now, on to bodily autonomy. You say you're in favour of doing it to infants rather than waiting until adulthood is because you don't need to use GA on infants. Well, it's interesting that *now* you're willing to consider the slim negative risks of GA (since yes, theoretically an adult choosing to be circumcised could have a negative reaction to GA and die) against the positives of waiting until adulthood so that the person in question can make the decision about their own body, when you seem perfectly happy to ignore the slim negative risks of neonatal circumcision--which, again, go beyond the \"normal\" stuff like excessive bleeding or infection, but can include not-uncommon issues like overly tight circumcisions causing pain with erections later, since [the foreskin isn't some small flap of skin](http://image.slidesharecdn.com/circumcision-100326084559-phpapp02/95/circumcision-18-728.jpg?cb=1269612546) as some people seem to think (NSFW warning, dicks). Why is an adult choosing to make a decision with a very low risk of negative side effects bad to you, but an infant with no say having a choice pushed upon him that also has some low risks of negative medical side effects is... not that bad? I'm curious as to the logic there, because I'm very into bodily autonomy in general but need clearer ground to actually be able to debate you.\n\nAnother thing to be aware of is that infant foreskins are not retractable. They are gently fused to the glans, much in the way our fingernails are fused to our fingers, and are supposed to remain that way until anywhere between two years old and puberty. That means that performing the circumcision on a neonate *also* requires ripping the foreskin up off the penis before it can be cut off (leaving the whole glans injured as well as unprotected). That's why mistakes are easy to make, and you can end up with an erection curving in an odd or painful way because of scar tissue and insufficient skin for a \"grower\". The foreskin is only retractable and distinct in much older boys and men.\n\nNow, I don't think circumcision should be unilaterally illegal. But, much like **any other surgery you do on children**, it should be something that has to have a medical reason for it. Because to do it without reason isn't ethical.
