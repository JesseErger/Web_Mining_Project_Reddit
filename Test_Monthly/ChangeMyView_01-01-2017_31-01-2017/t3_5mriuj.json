I disagree with this premise. We have lots of countries and states to draw conclusions from. I agree it's not as clearcut as the hard sciences such as physics or math but clearly communism didn't work, and unfettered capitalism sucked and the unions were a blessing. Germany's workers have strong unions and Germany's middle is doing great economically. Much better than the american middle class. These are facts we can base conclusions upon.\n\nThose aren't facts though, which illustrates my point. Saying \"the unions were a blessing\" is an absurdly vague statement. Sometimes unions are good, sometimes they are bad. When they start coercing people into membership, when they use their members dues for against the interest of those members, when they become too big and begin lobbying the government, that's not so good. And I don't know what you mean by \"unfettered capitalism\" but we never had it. \n\nAlso, you SAID you disagree with me, but then you agreed with me. I'm not saying you can't try to be scientific with economics or sociology, I said they are inherently resistant, and they are. What does that mean? It means they're much harder to nail down factually, which means ideology and personal tendencies reign more than they can in more scientific fields.\n\n&gt;You make a good point. i cannot defend this reasoning so I will abandon it. Can you make the opposite case?\n\nWhat do you mean by the opposite case?\n\n&gt;6th largest economy in the world (google it). But it doesn't matter since I have no control states like you said. I'm just answering this to satisfy your curiosity.\n\nDoing great implies their performance has been good. They could be \"doing terribly\" and still have a huge economy. It's all relative.\n\n&gt;Of course most liberals aren't purely rational. I said so in the OP...Even mentioned GMOs/antivax/antinuclear. I'm not completely delusional ;)\n\nI said that in response to you saying \"no liberal would disagree [that a good idea is a good idea no matter where it comes from].\" If you experienced liberals the way I do, I don't think you would have such a dismal view of republicans.\n\n&gt;Again, i'm assuming budding journalists are neutral and openminded and form their opinions in a rational manner. It is up to you to make the case for why they are not. Same as with universities. Hmm..how do I put it. If I see a glass with clear liquid in it, I'll assume it's water without either sugar or salt. I feel you're saying the water is salty without giving me a reason why. The neutral thing is to assume it's neither sweet nor salty. Does my horrible example make enough sense? _u\n\nI don't agree with this. If you see a group of people who are left-leaning, you're claiming they became liberal as a result of learning about the world, I'm saying they were liberal beforehand. I don't see why yours is any more of a \"default\" than mine. For instance, obviously certain people will have a tendency to go into certain careers. For you to assume they were identical to the general population beforehand seems like a pretty big assumption, given how deep rooted political beliefs are, and how early they start to take root.\n\n&gt;I trust rational arguments backed by data, no matter where they come from. Educated does not mean intelligent. Plenty of educated idiots out there. What I do NOT trust is people's \"common sense\" and whatnot.\n\n&gt;I'm glad you despise Trump. Did you disregard 3/4 of the evidence I laid out that shows he's a racist and focus on the mexicans? And by the way, do you have a cite for that? Is that cite going to show that the majority are rapists and killers and \"some\" are good people? Are all the colored people and all the countries outside the U.S that have concluded he's racist wrong? Obviously if we're white, we will be blind to racism since it doesn't affect you or I.\n\nI don't believe he said the majority are rapists and killers, did he? He just said that's who they're sending. It's a vague and inflammatory thing to say because he's a demagogue who isn't interested in the truth, but my problem is with people *using that* to make a broader point, which isn't true. There is a problem with those issues being elevated among that group of people. I don't think we need to lie about something just to show why trump is fucked up, he's fucked up enough on his own. So no, the source won't say that MOST of them are rapists/killers, but it will show that they have higher rates than the general population. Would that be enough for you? Because if it is, I'll dig up a source, if not I won't waste my time.\n\n&gt;They can be used as such, but as I said...I am ignorant of many things and I am racist. I think the test of character is having the humility to admit ones flaws and to fight one's baser impulses.\n\nSo if you think everybody is a racist, it becomes a meaningless label. Hillary Clinton is a racist by that logic, so people who voted for her are voting for a racist.\n\n&gt;By using words like some, I am being precise. this whole thing about being inflammatory is...off topic at best. I'm not a diplomat being paid to say sweet half-lies and spin. I believe what I say. Doesn't mean there aren't racist democrats as well. There are plenty of them. Did it sound like I believe there aren't? That is NOT the case.\n\nThat's not precise, it's completely unproductive. If I say \"a lot of liberals hate america,\" how is anybody supposed to respond to that? \n\n&gt;Yes you should (I mean it sincerely. I would upvote it) and yes you are right about that. I'm not being flippant here. I know it may sound like I am, but I am not. Truth is often hurtful. It's the lies that are sweet and soothing. I'm certain you know this.\n\nI just think it's not productive and distracts from the real issues. I'd rather focus on the core of what is creating the left-right divide, rather than try to pick on the mostly irrelevant features of the people on each side that crop up. It is NOT productive for me to harp on liberals for being more anti-white, anti-male, anti-american, etc. than conservatives. I'd rather take the **best** versions of their arguments and try to refute those.\n\n&gt;Poor people DO commit more (violent) crimes. Absolutely. For obvious reasons. If you count tax evasion as a crime, maybe rich people commit more crimes, however. Or maybe not! shrug. This is off-topic, obviously and doesn't affect my arguments.\n\nHow is this off-topic? You randomly brought up that the left are \"right about rich people generally being less empathetic\" as if this is supposed to mean something. If the left are right about that, then the right are SUPER right about the poor committing more crimes, being more of a drain on society, working fewer hours. But because you're a liberal you explain that away while fully accepting the criticism of the rich, when in reality BOTH are responding to their environment, it's just your biases make you subjectively connect more with the criticism of the rich, that's it.\n\n&gt;Do you remember how things were before Obamacare? Do you recognize that we have tens of millions less uninsured people than before thanks to Obamacare? Do you recognize that the increases in healthcare cost have slowed (they still increase but more slowly than before) because of Obamacare?\n\nHealthcare costs were already beginning to slow before the ACA even was enacted. They really sharply spiked in the late 90s and started to come down throughout the 2000s. [This is not an Obamacare story](https://www.towerswatson.com/en/Press/2015/10/rate-of-increase-in-health-care-costs-in-2015).\n\n&gt;* What would you replace Obamacare with?\n\nAnything that promotes competition in a free market. I'm not a healthcare expert, but it is an extremely regulated industry. The tradition of employers providing health insurance, which creates all kinds of problems, is something that government created. I would do everything from allowing insurers to operate across state lines, to lifting restrictions on advertising prices for procedures, etc. Anything that provides people with incentives to shop around and pick things that are best for them.\n\n&gt;* Do you recognize that it's true that republicans have had 8 years to present an alternative and have not, and now they're going to repeal it WITHOUT an alternative on the table still?\n\nRepublicans are frequently mentioning the things I said above.\n\n&gt;* Why do you think that is?\n\nIt isn't.\n\n&gt;I truly want honest answers to all 3 of these questions, because I believe their behavior regarding american health is absolutely the easiest case to make to show how immoral republican politicians are and how little compassion they have for the poor and the middle class.\n\n\"Your side\" has created the problem, and you call republicans immoral for not being able to fix it?\n\n&gt;Finally, to end on a positive note. My respect for you has increased even more because of how much time you took to answer me and how much effort you put into it. I truly thank you for engaging with me. I hope the feeling is mutual because it would sadden me if it is not.\n\nIt is, but I would hope in the future you focus more on the specifics and facts, rather than just flippant accusations. I appreciate that you are taking the time to delve into the issues specifically, but I feel like there's no reason for the scope to be so large. I generally don't agree with this \"throw a bunch of stuff against the wall and see what sticks\" approach, and think it's more productive to pick a topic and focus on it.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is the crux of our argument.

Do you recognize that we have tens of millions less uninsured people than before thanks to Obamacare? Do you recognize that the increases in healthcare cost have slowed (they still increase but more slowly than before) because of Obamacare?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Healthcare costs were already beginning to slow before the ACA even was enacted. They really sharply spiked in the late 90s and started to come down throughout the 2000s. &lt;a href=\"https://www.towerswatson.com/en/Press/2015/10/rate-of-increase-in-health-care-costs-in-2015\"&gt;This is not an Obamacare story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What would you replace Obamacare with?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything that promotes competition in a free market. I&amp;#39;m not a healthcare expert, but it is an extremely regulated industry. The tradition of employers providing health insurance, which creates all kinds of problems, is something that government created. I would do everything from allowing insurers to operate across state lines, to lifting restrictions on advertising prices for procedures, etc. Anything that provides people with incentives to shop around and pick things that are best for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Do you recognize that it&amp;#39;s true that republicans have had 8 years to present an alternative and have not, and now they&amp;#39;re going to repeal it WITHOUT an alternative on the table still?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Republicans are frequently mentioning the things I said above.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Why do you think that is?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I truly want honest answers to all 3 of these questions, because I believe their behavior regarding american health is absolutely the easiest case to make to show how immoral republican politicians are and how little compassion they have for the poor and the middle class.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your side&amp;quot; has created the problem, and you call republicans immoral for not being able to fix it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, to end on a positive note. My respect for you has increased even more because of how much time you took to answer me and how much effort you put into it. I truly thank you for engaging with me. I hope the feeling is mutual because it would sadden me if it is not.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is, but I would hope in the future you focus more on the specifics and facts, rather than just flippant accusations. I appreciate that you are taking the time to delve into the issues specifically, but I feel like there&amp;#39;s no reason for the scope to be so large. I generally don&amp;#39;t agree with this &amp;quot;throw a bunch of stuff against the wall and see what sticks&amp;quot; approach, and think it&amp;#39;s more productive to pick a topic and focus on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc6jr3g", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5mriuj/cmv_republican_politicians_actions_are_evil_and/dc6jr3g/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483956852.0, "author_flair_text": "15\u2206", "created_utc": 1483928052.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mriuj", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 2, "name": "t1_dcmmx0o", "id": "dcmmx0o", "parent_id": "t1_dc6jqv7", "depth": 5, "children": ["dcmmx0o"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc6jqv7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Holophonist", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc68kgc", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt;Glad we agree. You didn't mention the gun part so I assume you agree with that too. I already acknowledged that many democrats hold simplistic views. I agree about what you said about outsourcing.\n\nNo I actually don't agree about the gun thing. I think Obama is a savvy politician and recognized how unpopular it would be to do anything too rash about guns, but it's not at all unreasonable for people to have expected him to do so, given what he's said about guns in the past, including praising Australia's mandatory buy back program. You can't say they were proven wrong when in reality you don't know if Obama behaved in such a way given people's expectations.\n\nSo if you agree that Democrats hold similar views, how is it helpful to focus on the republicans? Wouldn't you want to single out the things you think republicans are unique in? Until Trump it was the right that were gung-ho about free trade and automation and technology, etc. It saddens me that a lot of that support is gone, but I don't see the left being any more receptive to it, and the ones that are, are only doing so because they hate trump!\n\n&gt;Sure, that study is not perfect but it is one of many. You did not address the youtube video I mentioned though. Do you find fault with it too?\n\n&gt;Here is another study: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797616667721\n\n&gt;Here are 5 more:\n\n&gt;http://blog.ted.com/6-studies-of-money-and-the-mind/\n\n&gt;Do you have studies that supports your view? I'm willing to look at it but I believe it's not enough to just criticize and find fault with my case, you must build your case too. It's always easier to destroy than to build, after all.\n\n&gt;Never said that. I said they lack empathy and I've now provided several studies that show it. Feel free to cite studies that contradict me if you know of any.\n\nI said immoral because the study was researching ethics and morality, the traffic violations one. That's the one with the glaring flaws that I mentioned in my previous reply.\n\nOne of the other studies showed that the heart rates of individuals indicated that showing videos of children with cancer to higher income people elicited less of a response than lower income people. Maybe that's empathy, maybe it's not. I know that having grown up poor I have fairly specific unpleasant reactions certain things, like food being left out on counters, especially when it starts to turn. That happens because I've been around it. So maybe it's people being more empathetic, maybe it's just familiarity stirring anxiety.\n\nAnother study was where they are in a game with 5 people, one person being \"in charge\" so to speak, and the person in charge can choose to take a dollar from somebody and turn it into more dollars and spread it around to other people but having it be multiplied, thus creating more dollars than initially in the game, and richer people were more likely to do so. This is can be viewed as a lack of empathy, or an elevated utilitarian worldview.\n\nI'm pretty sure if I keep going through these studies there will be similar explanations to them as well. But it's not really important because what relevance does this have? Even if all of these studies are flawed (and I'm not saying they are) and rich people don't have decreased levels of empathy, I'm sure they have some *other* flaws that poor people don't, just like poor people will have some flaws that rich people don't. They are people in different environments responding in different ways. Again, what's the point?\n\n&gt;You hold...lowdown.\n\nReally? You do literally anything to remove the tumor? What if you don't know how long it will take the tumor to kill you and it's possible that new technology will save you in the near future? Should you say \"I don't have time to wait for that!\" and just take a knife and cut the tumor out yourself? Because the fact is the \"real\" answer to global warming is going to lie somewhere between the extremes of \"do nothing\" and \"do everything right now,\" and it's not at all clear or obvious to me where that line is. Let's be honest, the left is on one side of the climate change debate not because of facts or empiricism, it's because of pure chance. Environmentalism is seated deep in the american left for a host of reasons, not the least of which is the anti-capitalist anti-industrialization tendency. So it's all fine and well that climate change is real and you get to score some political points, but let's not pretend the left was just responding to facts and they are the party of rationality etc. They were on board with every environmentalist scare for the past 50 years, some were true, some weren't.\n\n&gt;I'm for meritocra...rrectly though.\n\nNot sure which poll you mean. If you're talking about the LA times poll, it was actually off more than most on an absolute scale, even if it predicted trump would win. If you mean 538's model, they still predicted Hillary would win, they were just prescient enough to see that state polling errors are likely correlated, which made it possible for trump to pick up a win, which is exactly what happened in the rust belt, where most state polls were off by about 6 or 7%.\n\nAs for \"elitism,\" it doesn't really matter how you use it, because we're talking about the tendency of republicans. What they hate is the elitism I mentioned.\n\n&gt;I did not say that. Please don't distort my views. If you do, how can you possibly respect me or take me seriously? I wouldn't respect someone who says \"republicans are racist and evil\". Quote my exact words, THEN criticize them.\n\nThe point is the same. People tend to act in their own self interest, so why is that bad only when rich people do it?\n\n&gt;Beca...ity.\n\nThat last bit is pure assertion, I'm not sure how you can claim to know the biases of these professors so intimately. As for the rest:\n\n&gt;Why is the professoriate predominantly liberal? A. Because \u201cThere is an intrinsic link between liberalism and intelligence such that the more liberal views of those with advanced degrees reflect liberals\u2019 greater academic potential.\u201d [The liberals-are-smarter theory] ..... **E. Because \u201cThe professoriate acquired a reputation as a liberal occupation\u201d and liberals today \u201cacting on the basis of this reputation and seeking careers that accord with their political identities, are more likely than conservatives to aspire to become academics.\u201d** ... **Their answer is an emphatic E. \u201cSelf-selection\u201d in their view is the only answer for which they can find robust empirical support.** If they are right, this should change one of the longest-running and often most bitter debates in contemporary higher education.\n\nhttps://www.nas.org/articles/Why_Are_Most_College_Professors_Liberal_New_Studies_Investigate\n\nFurthermore, [they are becoming more liberal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/11/the-dramatic-shift-among-college-professors-thats-hurting-students-education/?utm_term=.de42a1cf5470), which given your hypothesis wouldn't make any sense. Furthermore, we can [see](http://www.people-press.org/2016/04/26/a-wider-ideological-gap-between-more-and-less-educated-adults/) that they are more liberal than the general population before even becoming professors.\n\nThe answer is pretty clear: it's cultural. Consider this, those \"best and brightest\" that you think hold liberal views because they know more than everybody else, they hold *consistently* liberal views. So a sociology professor will tend to hold liberal views on economics, despite never studying it. This does not really jive with your assertion, that they are liberal because liberal positions are right and they are smart enough to know what is right.\n\nAnd while we're on the subject, liberals artificially controlling the \"commanding heights\" of the media and academia, lends a tremendous amount of ammunition to the idea that liberals are more fact-based, or other similar claims. Liberals are doing most of the research, and their biases will undeniably seep in. When liberally-biased research is published, the left-leaning media will repeat it ad nauseum. One study gets published and then basically all of the google results on the first page will basically be about THAT study. It's a self perpetuating cycle, and it's what gives rise to alternative media like talk radio, fox news, conservative websites, etc. Conservatives were an untapped market because the media has a bias, which is how conservative media became so huge so fast. I suspect (and hope) that as traditional education crumbles and the more nimble curriculum like micro degrees and MOOCs, you'll see something of a resurgence from conservatives as well. I already see the nucleus of that movement in the young conservatives on the internet and in universities.

I personally think that a president has to be more diplomatic than that, but that makes him a horrible politician, it doesn't make him a racist. And more importantly, the people who vote for him aren't racists because he said some dumb shit.

I hate trump too, but what is the point? He's a historically unpopular candidate and president-elect, even among republicans. Shouldn't this tell you that people are voting for him pragmatically, but despise him personally? And as much as I despise trump for not disavowing david duke, that does not make him a racist, it makes him an immoral opportunist.

I do not generalize to all republicans. Also, I don't think of \"racist\" and \"ignorant\" as insults.

They should think I'm misguided or naive or whatever. I'm advocating policies that I believe with all my heart would be beneficial to all but the top 0.1% of wealth owners. Hatred is poison for the soul.\n\nI don't believe there is something inherently wrong with hatred in the way I'm using it here. Show me a man whose greatest virtue is tolerance, and I'll show you a man with no convictions.\n\n&gt;Is this source good enough for you?\n\n&gt;http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/12/19/trump-counties-would-see-big-impact-from-obamacare-repeal/\n\nNo because the assumption is that the only option is either what we had before obamacare or obamacare. This is not true, and that's a terrible way of viewing things. I'm going by the title of the article though because I can't read it. If you think there's something in there that proves me wrong, please post it directly. Not only can I not view the article, but I hate when somebody makes a specific claim then posts a long-winded article to \"back it up\" without having anything in the article that actually backs it up. You shouldn't need an editorial to make a point, just post the facts.\n\n&gt;The rich do not need tax cuts.... living in one of the countries with the lowest taxes already.\n\nOh dear. First of all, tax cuts are not about what the person needs. That is framing the debate in a horrible way, which is the assumption that society gets your money unless you need it. Guess what, historically speaking almost nobody in america NEEDS all of the money they have. The poorest in the US are still in the top 75% worldwide TODAY, let alone throughout humanity's relatively dismal history.\n\nAside from that, it's not clear when tax cuts are beneficial and when they aren't. Conservatives want a generally low tax and low regulation environment so that productivity and innovation can flourish.\n\n&gt;Nobel prize economists agree on this. People who've spent their entire professional lives studying the matter agree on this.\n\n&gt;http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/05/economist-explains\n\nSo where in that article does it say economists agree that large tax hikes, such as 90% marginal rates after WWII are necessary? It doesn't. Why do liberals think making a wild claim and then posting a link to some unrelated article makes you right? That doesn't even make sense, because most people didn't even pay those rates. [Here](http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2012/11/republican-staff-study.html) is an explanation of how marginal rates relate to effective rates.\n\nBesides, Piketty is one guy and he's *known* for being for extremely aggressive redistributive policies. The fact is the question is a lot more complex than you think. For instance, I'm sure many economists agree that raising taxes would be best for the budget at least in the short term, because raising taxes will tend to increase revenues, but they don't all agree on what an increase in taxes will do to the business environment in the country. For instance: http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-do-economists-agree-and-disagree-about-effects-taxes-economic-growth . Notice how many highly specific scenarios they lay out. It's not as simple as \"we need to raise taxes on the rich.\" Which taxes? By how much? And what will that do in the short term? The long term? It's also specific to our current environment. For instance, Trump is proposing a one time repatriation bonus for companies/people who want to bring money back from overseas. That is essentially a \"tax cut\" that is tailored specifically to a situation where we have a lot of overseas money.\n\n&gt;Finally, I should add that I was firmly pro-business and pro-capitalism for the same reasons you are (competition, ingenuity, nimbleness, incentives, etc.) when I moved to America and became a citizen. I want the republican party to reform and be fact-based and less ideology-based so I can vote for it. I'm all about facts and the scientific method: test it! don't believe it just because it feels right and be ready to admit you're wrong if it fails.\n\nNone of these issues are going to be factually proven one way or the other, that's the problem. So while being \"Fact-based\" is fine and dandy, you're introducing way more noise than signal by posting irrelevant \"facts\" and thinking it's an argument. **Where we disagree is not on facts**. We're going to disagree on much more base, emotional assumptions about how the world/people work. Please tell me a single thing I (a conservative) belief that is factually wrong. A single thing. Because notice all you've done is post opinion articles, or stuff that isn't relevant like rich people being immoral. Not only are there problems with that, like I mentioned above, but it's also not relevant at all. Should I start posting facts about poor people committing more crimes? Or working fewer hours? The fact is different demographics have different characteristics. You're just being petty by trying to randomly pick out things that are unfavorable about the demographic you don't agree with.\n\n&gt;Romney-care is a good example of sensible, fact-based republican policy. Reached my comment limit!\n\nYeah cause you agree with it, no wonder you call it sensible!

I want the republican party to reform and be fact-based and less ideology-based so I can vote for it. I&amp;#39;m all about facts and the scientific method: test it! don&amp;#39;t believe it just because it feels right and be ready to admit you&amp;#39;re wrong if it fails.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of these issues are going to be factually proven one way or the other, that&amp;#39;s the problem. So while being &amp;quot;Fact-based&amp;quot; is fine and dandy, you&amp;#39;re introducing way more noise than signal by posting irrelevant &amp;quot;facts&amp;quot; and thinking it&amp;#39;s an argument. &lt;strong&gt;Where we disagree is not on facts&lt;/strong&gt;. We&amp;#39;re going to disagree on much more base, emotional assumptions about how the world/people work. Please tell me a single thing I (a conservative) belief that is factually wrong. A single thing. Because notice all you&amp;#39;ve done is post opinion articles, or stuff that isn&amp;#39;t relevant like rich people being immoral. Not only are there problems with that, like I mentioned above, but it&amp;#39;s also not relevant at all. Should I start posting facts about poor people committing more crimes? Or working fewer hours? The fact is different demographics have different characteristics. You&amp;#39;re just being petty by trying to randomly pick out things that are unfavorable about the demographic you don&amp;#39;t agree with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Romney-care is a good example of sensible, fact-based republican policy. Reached my comment limit!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah cause you agree with it, no wonder you call it sensible! Obamacare is a silly, failed policy that is so clearly a thinly veiled attempt at transitioning into single payer. This is what conservative commentators were saying at the time, and it&amp;#39;s where the national conversation is going next.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc5z1hy", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5mriuj/cmv_republican_politicians_actions_are_evil_and/dc5z1hy/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483931322.0, "author_flair_text": "15\u2206", "created_utc": 1483902522.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 4, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mriuj", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mriuj", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc66xg1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gozu", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc5z0fy", "score": -1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt;I would agree that the populist wing of the right is wrong about the effects of immigration\n\nGlad we agree.

It claims that \"rich people\" are less \"moral\" and one of the ways it backs this up is a study where somebody observed traffic violations of high value cars. This sounds good for the kind of person I'm talking about, the kind of person who worships anything that sounds intellectual and scientific *but doesn't understand the science behind it.* For instance, car value is not a perfect proxy for wealth, and traffic violations are not a perfect proxy for morality. Beyond that, you're *introducing* other confounding variables that are likely driving things (no pun intended). For instance, are you running the stop sign because you're rich or are you running the stop sign because you're the type of person to buy an expensive car? Those are very different claims.\n\nAs for global warming, define \"right about global warming\" because a lot of them are NOT right about global warming. I agree that co2 emissions will have a warming effect on the planet, but many leftwing predictions related to climate change ended up being exaggerated or wrong. Didn't Al Gore say some hyperbolic shit about huge portions of land being underwater by 2015 or 2020 or something? So again, this is taking a kernel of sciencey sounding stuff, or even a kernel of truth and using that as a cudgel against many other things that aren't applicable.\n\nThe current typical \"rightwing\" position on climate change is not that it isn't real at all, it's that it's not necessarily a good idea to lower our growth in a futile attempt to curb it, specifically when many other countries aren't doing so. This was the extremely conservative Marco Rubio's position.\n\nI don't deny that a lot of republicans were late in changing their views, but at the same time it's hard to blame them. There have been many exaggerated catastrophic claims from environmentalists in the past. At least they are changing their views in the face of evidence.\n\n&gt;What does it mean to hate elitism? Elite means superior in terms of abilities (natural or acquired). An elite marksman is someone who aims better and hits the target more often. An elite runner is someone who runs faster or longer, etc. If you want to kill nazis, would you pick joe schmoe or an elite marksman? It's illogical to hate elites.\n\nNo this is not an accurate description of how the term is used. When somebody talks about \"the elites\" they don't mean \"people who are objectively better or smarter than me\" they're talking about people in elite positions, and elitism is the idea that those people should have undue power over everybody else. So even using your definition, one really smart people is not necessarily smarter than 1000 average people. Being anti-elitism is to desire diffuse knowledge, the wisdom of crowds, to rule over a couple of the \"smartest people in the room.\" As a recent example, look at Trump's election. The elites got it embarrassingly wrong. And btw, I was one of the people who thought Trump had no shot, so I don't dislike intelligence or empiricism, I'm a data analyst for fuck's sake. But there is certainly something to be said about concentrating power in the hands of a few people.\n\n&gt;What's even more mind-boggling to me is to just hate elite liberal universities and liberal professors. Why do they think those people are liberal? If I study cigarettes and find out they cause cancer and become pro-clean air/ anti-tobacco, it's a fact-based, results-based, experiment-based, science-based position.\n\n&gt;It should tell you something if the people with the most knowledge are more liberal. They found out that progressive taxes are better for the economy. That universal healthcare decreases societal costs (ER visits, productivity of healthy vs sick, expensive end of life treatments vs prevention, avoidable deaths of smart useful people who contribute to society, emotional trauma of loved ones leading to more lost productivity, the list is super-long).\n\nWhy are you assuming they are liberal as a result of the knowledge they gain? The fact is they are liberal before even going into the profession, and that the culture in those places are extremely hostile to conservatives. There is a well documented history of how and why college campuses are so wildly leftwing, and it's not because \"reality has a liberal bias.\" This is a perfect example of the problems of elitism. You just trust some people because they're smart, not because of any rational arguments. If a liberal position is the \"right\" position, then explain why. Because the bottom line is that when it comes to policy, there is rarely a universally \"right\" side. Both sides have valid arguments that aren't possible to test empirically, specifically when it comes to economics or social issues, which are inherently resistant to scientific methods.\n\n&gt;These people became liberal as they understood the problem more, they became liberal as they tested and studied potential solutions. Knowledge (which is surely universally respected and striven for) leads to liberalism. It's not a freak accident of nature or god knows what else. This is a core obvious thing to me. California's doing great. NYC is doing great. In general, if you take states as laboratories of democracy, the obvious trend is that liberal policies generate more wealth for everybody.\n\nThis isn't true. College *students* are already very liberal. The ones that stick around in academia tend to be more liberal before they even become experts. The people who don't, aren't.\n\nAs for states, this is another example of somebody who knows just enough to be dangerous, but not enough to be right. Again this is a problem of confounding factors and also cherry-picking data. Blue states tend to be cultural and commercial *hubs*. This leads to prosperity and incidentally also liberalism, that doesn't mean liberalism is causing prosperity. **REAL** science needs to control for different factors.\n\nNot to mention there are numerous examples of democratically controlled shithole cities and states. Not to mention I'm not so sure california is \"doing great.\" I'm not a resident there and don't follow it, but what makes you think it's doing great?\n\n&gt;A good idea is good no matter where it comes from, of course. Try it out, see if it works, if it does adopt it. No liberal would disagree with that. If it turns out having a dozen car companies leads to better cars, compared to one state owned manufacturer, then that's the way things should be, regardless of political convictions. (this is a great example of capitalism working the way it should).\n\nYou say \"no liberal would disagree\" but that flies in the face of almost every single argument I've had with a liberal on reddit. When you get down to the core of their beliefs, it's almost always based on gut feeling, prejudice, etc. The same is going to be true for any regular person on any side, but you really need to stop thinking that liberal people are purely rational, because they aren't.\n\n&gt;The same thing is true of the media. These people are not born swearing allegiance to leftist ideals. They learn and investigate and read and learn some more, and find out reality has a \"liberal bias\". We CANNOT trust our gut feelings and \"common sense\" and decline to test our theories. The media is actually not wildly liberal at all. it just has decided to go with facts and science even if they're uncomfortable.\n\nAgain you're saying this with nothing to back it up. Show me that members of the media became *more liberal* as they investigated things, and **ALSO** that this isn't from a culture of hostility towards conservative ideas.\n\nAnd I actually agree that the *media* is not wildly liberal, but they are consistently on the side of the democratic establishment.

Those are very different claims.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for global warming, define &amp;quot;right about global warming&amp;quot; because a lot of them are NOT right about global warming. I agree that co2 emissions will have a warming effect on the planet, but many leftwing predictions related to climate change ended up being exaggerated or wrong. Didn&amp;#39;t Al Gore say some hyperbolic shit about huge portions of land being underwater by 2015 or 2020 or something? So again, this is taking a kernel of sciencey sounding stuff, or even a kernel of truth and using that as a cudgel against many other things that aren&amp;#39;t applicable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The current typical &amp;quot;rightwing&amp;quot; position on climate change is not that it isn&amp;#39;t real at all, it&amp;#39;s that it&amp;#39;s not necessarily a good idea to lower our growth in a futile attempt to curb it, specifically when many other countries aren&amp;#39;t doing so. This was the extremely conservative Marco Rubio&amp;#39;s position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t deny that a lot of republicans were late in changing their views, but at the same time it&amp;#39;s hard to blame them. There have been many exaggerated catastrophic claims from environmentalists in the past. At least they are changing their views in the face of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to hate elitism? Elite means superior in terms of abilities (natural or acquired). An elite marksman is someone who aims better and hits the target more often. An elite runner is someone who runs faster or longer, etc. If you want to kill nazis, would you pick joe schmoe or an elite marksman? It&amp;#39;s illogical to hate elites.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No this is not an accurate description of how the term is used. When somebody talks about &amp;quot;the elites&amp;quot; they don&amp;#39;t mean &amp;quot;people who are objectively better or smarter than me&amp;quot; they&amp;#39;re talking about people in elite positions, and elitism is the idea that those people should have undue power over everybody else. So even using your definition, one really smart people is not necessarily smarter than 1000 average people. Being anti-elitism is to desire diffuse knowledge, the wisdom of crowds, to rule over a couple of the &amp;quot;smartest people in the room.&amp;quot; As a recent example, look at Trump&amp;#39;s election. The elites got it embarrassingly wrong. And btw, I was one of the people who thought Trump had no shot, so I don&amp;#39;t dislike intelligence or empiricism, I&amp;#39;m a data analyst for fuck&amp;#39;s sake. But there is certainly something to be said about concentrating power in the hands of a few people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s even more mind-boggling to me is to just hate elite liberal universities and liberal professors. Why do they think those people are liberal? If I study cigarettes and find out they cause cancer and become pro-clean air/ anti-tobacco, it&amp;#39;s a fact-based, results-based, experiment-based, science-based position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It should tell you something if the people with the most knowledge are more liberal. They found out that progressive taxes are better for the economy. That universal healthcare decreases societal costs (ER visits, productivity of healthy vs sick, expensive end of life treatments vs prevention, avoidable deaths of smart useful people who contribute to society, emotional trauma of loved ones leading to more lost productivity, the list is super-long).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why are you assuming they are liberal as a result of the knowledge they gain? The fact is they are liberal before even going into the profession, and that the culture in those places are extremely hostile to conservatives. There is a well documented history of how and why college campuses are so wildly leftwing, and it&amp;#39;s not because &amp;quot;reality has a liberal bias.&amp;quot; This is a perfect example of the problems of elitism. You just trust some people because they&amp;#39;re smart, not because of any rational arguments. If a liberal position is the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; position, then explain why. Because the bottom line is that when it comes to policy, there is rarely a universally &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; side. Both sides have valid arguments that aren&amp;#39;t possible to test empirically, specifically when it comes to economics or social issues, which are inherently resistant to scientific methods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These people became liberal as they understood the problem more, they became liberal as they tested and studied potential solutions. Knowledge (which is surely universally respected and striven for) leads to liberalism. It&amp;#39;s not a freak accident of nature or god knows what else. This is a core obvious thing to me. California&amp;#39;s doing great. NYC is doing great. In general, if you take states as laboratories of democracy, the obvious trend is that liberal policies generate more wealth for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t true. College &lt;em&gt;students&lt;/em&gt; are already very liberal. The ones that stick around in academia tend to be more liberal before they even become experts. The people who don&amp;#39;t, aren&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for states, this is another example of somebody who knows just enough to be dangerous, but not enough to be right. Again this is a problem of confounding factors and also cherry-picking data. Blue states tend to be cultural and commercial &lt;em&gt;hubs&lt;/em&gt;. This leads to prosperity and incidentally also liberalism, that doesn&amp;#39;t mean liberalism is causing prosperity. &lt;strong&gt;REAL&lt;/strong&gt; science needs to control for different factors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to mention there are numerous examples of democratically controlled shithole cities and states. Not to mention I&amp;#39;m not so sure california is &amp;quot;doing great.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m not a resident there and don&amp;#39;t follow it, but what makes you think it&amp;#39;s doing great?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A good idea is good no matter where it comes from, of course. Try it out, see if it works, if it does adopt it. No liberal would disagree with that. If it turns out having a dozen car companies leads to better cars, compared to one state owned manufacturer, then that&amp;#39;s the way things should be, regardless of political convictions. (this is a great example of capitalism working the way it should).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You say &amp;quot;no liberal would disagree&amp;quot; but that flies in the face of almost every single argument I&amp;#39;ve had with a liberal on reddit. When you get down to the core of their beliefs, it&amp;#39;s almost always based on gut feeling, prejudice, etc. The same is going to be true for any regular person on any side, but you really need to stop thinking that liberal people are purely rational, because they aren&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The same thing is true of the media. These people are not born swearing allegiance to leftist ideals. They learn and investigate and read and learn some more, and find out reality has a &amp;quot;liberal bias&amp;quot;. We CANNOT trust our gut feelings and &amp;quot;common sense&amp;quot; and decline to test our theories. The media is actually not wildly liberal at all. it just has decided to go with facts and science even if they&amp;#39;re uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again you&amp;#39;re saying this with nothing to back it up. Show me that members of the media became &lt;em&gt;more liberal&lt;/em&gt; as they investigated things, and &lt;strong&gt;ALSO&lt;/strong&gt; that this isn&amp;#39;t from a culture of hostility towards conservative ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I actually agree that the &lt;em&gt;media&lt;/em&gt; is not wildly liberal, but they are consistently on the side of the democratic establishment. They&amp;#39;re not fringe marxists like a lot of academia, but they are left leaning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc5z0fy", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5mriuj/cmv_republican_politicians_actions_are_evil_and/dc5z0fy/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483931293.0, "author_flair_text": "15\u2206", "created_utc": 1483902493.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 5, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mriuj", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mriuj", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc68rtv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gozu", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc604ck", "score": -1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "i don't assume that.

They hate a few people confidently imposing rules from the top down on millions of people. Universities have become a pretty strong figurehead for that, and for liberal elitism in general, with professors being wildly leftwing. If you don't believe that liberal policies work, why would you believe liberal elites are more qualified to make policies? Isn't that the issue? That they don't agree with them?\n\nWhat does it mean to hate elitism? Elite means superior in terms of abilities (natural or acquired). An elite marksman is someone who aims better and hits the target more often. An elite runner is someone who runs faster or longer, etc. If you want to kill nazis, would you pick joe schmoe or an elite marksman?

The media is actually not *wildly* liberal at all. it just has decided to go with facts and science even if they're uncomfortable. \n\nI realized this when I took stochastics and epically failed at the Monty Hall problem. Everything in my being was telling me one thing, but crunching the numbers told me something different, and I learned not to trust myself at all. Only trust math. My gut is a goddamned liar. Colbert's truthiness (it *feels* true) is about just this.\n\nAs for republican politicians only caring about the rich. It is what it is. Being rich means you have political power in the form of political financing (Koch brothers and sheldon adelson are good examples). It is not strange that one of the parties will cater to you more than the other. If you are rich, you need nothing from the government. You have a helicopter, you have a private jet. You have houses in other countries. You can pay your own medical expenses, even if they go into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. You can pay private security to guard your house, bodyguards to follow you around. Nannies to look after your children, etc. etc. \n\nWhy would you care about universal pre-K childcare? Why would you care about health insurance? Why would you care about unemployment benefits or minimum wage? Why would you care about public transport? Why would you care about public defenders being understaffed and underpaid? Why would you care about a bail bondsmen (taking 10% of your bail regardless of innocence because you can't afford to drop the cash). \n\nIt just doesn't make sense for you to care about these things. I'm not blind so I don't really care about laws that help them. I'm childless so I don't really care about schools. This is just human beings being naturally selfish. \n\nAll you will care about is retaining the money that gives you all that comfort, power and freedom. The links posted earlier verify that. \n\nI said: Over 33% of the population are willing to tolerate racism as long as it's not aimed at them. This number percentage is significantly higher amongst white people.\n\n&gt;Can you provide a source for this? I'm having trouble understanding what point you're trying to make. It seems very contrived and not really relevant. It wouldn't surprise me if white people care less about racism in general than minority groups.\n\nTrump has made lots of racist comments. Mexican illegal immigrants being rapists and killers (and \"some\" are nice people) is extremely racist when you know that undocumented immigrants are less likely to break the law than citizens. How would you feel if Putin said \"Americans are killers, they're rapists and , some, I suppose, are good people\". \n\nHis comment about a gold star father not letting a gold star mother speak was another clearly very racist comment. His comment about not letting muslims into the country is also extremely racist. Refusing to rent to black people when he was young was also racist. Refusing to disavow David Duke and pretending he didn't know him was another. The man is a racist. It's not even a question. Therefore, every single person who voted for trump tolerates explicit, documented racism in their candidate. Therefore they tolerate racism. This includes 30% of latinos, 9% black, some muslims and so on. I'm not giving anybody a pass.\n\nI would like to hear the equivalents of libtard and cuck that liberal use. I would like to know of an equivalent action to roll-coaling that is widespread among their youth. I may be ignorant of such things. \n\nI was explicit in specifying that none of my comments apply to all republicans, using words like \"some\", \"a majority\" (ie: 51%) , \"a depressing amount\" and so on. I do not generalize to all republicans. Also, I don't think of \"racist\" and \"ignorant\" as insults. These are not derogatory terms like \"retard\" or \"cuckold\". \n\nI consider myself racist and sexist. No two ways about it. I just try to fight those tendencies whenever I identify them because I don't intellectually believe women or people of color are dumber or less capable than men. I do believe that everybody is racist to some degree because we humans are genetically engineered to be tribal and so forth. Babies will prefer their mother's language over another, faces of the same ethnicity as their mother and so on. Toddlers will like prettier people more than plain-looking people. The list goes on and on.\n\n&gt;Do you not get the irony? You are the perfect example of what they hate.\n\nThey should not hate me. I do not hate them. They should think I'm misguided or naive or whatever. I'm advocating policies that I believe with all my heart would be beneficial to all but the top 0.1% of wealth owners. Hatred is poison for the soul.\n\n&gt;You just said that repealing obamacare is factually against their interest. How in the fucking world do you call that a fact?\n\nIs this source good enough for you?\n\nhttp://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/12/19/trump-counties-would-see-big-impact-from-obamacare-repeal/\n\n&gt; How in the fucking world are you going to claim it's a fact that cutting taxes (for basically everybody) is going to be against their own interest. \n\nThe rich do not need tax cuts. They are not suffering. They eat well, have nice houses, send their children to any college they want, take vacations, never worry about bills or if they can afford $300 for a Dr visit. They need tax hikes. LARGE tax hikes like in post-ww2, which was an economic golden age for the middle class. if republicans were only cutting taxes for people earning less than 50K, they'd have my vote on that subject. Rich people do NOT need help, by definition, yet they are the largest beneficiaries of republican tax cuts, while living in one of the countries with the lowest taxes already. Nobel prize economists agree on this. People who've spent their entire professional lives studying the matter agree on this. \n\nhttp://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/05/economist-explains\n\nI would welcome any cites or references that contradict the ones I've posted. \n\nFinally, I should add that I was firmly pro-business and pro-capitalism for the same reasons you are (competition, ingenuity, nimbleness, incentives, etc.) when I moved to America and became a citizen. I want the republican party to reform and be fact-based and less ideology-based so I can vote for it. I'm all about facts and the scientific method: test it! don't believe it just because it feels right and be ready to admit you're wrong if it fails.\n\nRomney-care is a good example of sensible, fact-based republican policy.

If it turns out having a dozen car companies leads to better cars, compared to one state owned manufacturer, then that&amp;#39;s the way things should be, regardless of political convictions. (this is a great example of capitalism working the way it should). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same thing is true of the media. These people are not born swearing allegiance to leftist ideals. They learn and investigate and read and learn some more, and find out reality has a &amp;quot;liberal bias&amp;quot;. We CANNOT trust our gut feelings and &amp;quot;common sense&amp;quot; and decline to test our theories. The media is actually not &lt;em&gt;wildly&lt;/em&gt; liberal at all. it just has decided to go with facts and science even if they&amp;#39;re uncomfortable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized this when I took stochastics and epically failed at the Monty Hall problem. Everything in my being was telling me one thing, but crunching the numbers told me something different, and I learned not to trust myself at all. Only trust math. My gut is a goddamned liar. Colbert&amp;#39;s truthiness (it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; true) is about just this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for republican politicians only caring about the rich. It is what it is. Being rich means you have political power in the form of political financing (Koch brothers and sheldon adelson are good examples). It is not strange that one of the parties will cater to you more than the other. If you are rich, you need nothing from the government. You have a helicopter, you have a private jet. You have houses in other countries. You can pay your own medical expenses, even if they go into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. You can pay private security to guard your house, bodyguards to follow you around. Nannies to look after your children, etc. etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why would you care about universal pre-K childcare? Why would you care about health insurance? Why would you care about unemployment benefits or minimum wage? Why would you care about public transport? Why would you care about public defenders being understaffed and underpaid? Why would you care about a bail bondsmen (taking 10% of your bail regardless of innocence because you can&amp;#39;t afford to drop the cash). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just doesn&amp;#39;t make sense for you to care about these things. I&amp;#39;m not blind so I don&amp;#39;t really care about laws that help them. I&amp;#39;m childless so I don&amp;#39;t really care about schools. This is just human beings being naturally selfish. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All you will care about is retaining the money that gives you all that comfort, power and freedom. The links posted earlier verify that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I said: Over 33% of the population are willing to tolerate racism as long as it&amp;#39;s not aimed at them. This number percentage is significantly higher amongst white people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Can you provide a source for this? I&amp;#39;m having trouble understanding what point you&amp;#39;re trying to make. It seems very contrived and not really relevant. It wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise me if white people care less about racism in general than minority groups.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trump has made lots of racist comments. Mexican illegal immigrants being rapists and killers (and &amp;quot;some&amp;quot; are nice people) is extremely racist when you know that undocumented immigrants are less likely to break the law than citizens. How would you feel if Putin said &amp;quot;Americans are killers, they&amp;#39;re rapists and , some, I suppose, are good people&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His comment about a gold star father not letting a gold star mother speak was another clearly very racist comment. His comment about not letting muslims into the country is also extremely racist. Refusing to rent to black people when he was young was also racist. Refusing to disavow David Duke and pretending he didn&amp;#39;t know him was another. The man is a racist. It&amp;#39;s not even a question. Therefore, every single person who voted for trump tolerates explicit, documented racism in their candidate. Therefore they tolerate racism. This includes 30% of latinos, 9% black, some muslims and so on. I&amp;#39;m not giving anybody a pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like to hear the equivalents of libtard and cuck that liberal use. I would like to know of an equivalent action to roll-coaling that is widespread among their youth. I may be ignorant of such things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was explicit in specifying that none of my comments apply to all republicans, using words like &amp;quot;some&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a majority&amp;quot; (ie: 51%) , &amp;quot;a depressing amount&amp;quot; and so on. I do not generalize to all republicans. Also, I don&amp;#39;t think of &amp;quot;racist&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ignorant&amp;quot; as insults. These are not derogatory terms like &amp;quot;retard&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;cuckold&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I consider myself racist and sexist. No two ways about it. I just try to fight those tendencies whenever I identify them because I don&amp;#39;t intellectually believe women or people of color are dumber or less capable than men. I do believe that everybody is racist to some degree because we humans are genetically engineered to be tribal and so forth. Babies will prefer their mother&amp;#39;s language over another, faces of the same ethnicity as their mother and so on. Toddlers will like prettier people more than plain-looking people. The list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Do you not get the irony? You are the perfect example of what they hate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They should not hate me. I do not hate them. They should think I&amp;#39;m misguided or naive or whatever. I&amp;#39;m advocating policies that I believe with all my heart would be beneficial to all but the top 0.1% of wealth owners. Hatred is poison for the soul.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You just said that repealing obamacare is factually against their interest. How in the fucking world do you call that a fact?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this source good enough for you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/12/19/trump-counties-would-see-big-impact-from-obamacare-repeal/\"&gt;http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/12/19/trump-counties-would-see-big-impact-from-obamacare-repeal/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How in the fucking world are you going to claim it&amp;#39;s a fact that cutting taxes (for basically everybody) is going to be against their own interest. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rich do not need tax cuts. They are not suffering. They eat well, have nice houses, send their children to any college they want, take vacations, never worry about bills or if they can afford $300 for a Dr visit. They need tax hikes. LARGE tax hikes like in post-ww2, which was an economic golden age for the middle class. if republicans were only cutting taxes for people earning less than 50K, they&amp;#39;d have my vote on that subject. Rich people do NOT need help, by definition, yet they are the largest beneficiaries of republican tax cuts, while living in one of the countries with the lowest taxes already. Nobel prize economists agree on this. People who&amp;#39;ve spent their entire professional lives studying the matter agree on this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/05/economist-explains\"&gt;http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/05/economist-explains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would welcome any cites or references that contradict the ones I&amp;#39;ve posted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, I should add that I was firmly pro-business and pro-capitalism for the same reasons you are (competition, ingenuity, nimbleness, incentives, etc.) when I moved to America and became a citizen. I want the republican party to reform and be fact-based and less ideology-based so I can vote for it. I&amp;#39;m all about facts and the scientific method: test it! don&amp;#39;t believe it just because it feels right and be ready to admit you&amp;#39;re wrong if it fails.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Romney-care is a good example of sensible, fact-based republican policy.

I don't claim that any of the characteristics you claim are mutually exclusive with \"good\". I'm simply pointing out that you are happy to paint with a broad brush when it comes to conservatives, to point out characteristics that some have and draw simplistic conclusions about them all from those, but then you turn around and admit that some liberals share the same characteristics...and refuse to draw the same conclusions.\n\n&gt;You have not given me the equivalents of libtard or cuck. I've looked at your source and have not found equivalents. Of course there will be people who insult on both sides, but the amount and specificity are important. I believe you are drawing a false equivalency between the two camps. You've also not shown me anything equivalent to rolling coal on the liberal side. See Shepherd is an incredible stretch, seeing that they are not trying to enrage republicans, and are in fact operating globally antagonizing russian/japanese/whatever vessels and do not care about the country. Absolutely not equivalent.\n\nIf the only thing you'll accept is an exact equivalent of a given insult, google \"republitard\" (yes, a word people use). But the existence of specific terms is irrelevant. If you really do think that amount and specificity are important, I urge you to read the statistical breakdown in the given link. And yes, I DID give you an equivalent to rolling coal. Sea shepherd. You claim they're not trying to enrage republicans, but so what? They are extremist liberals, doing everything they can to draw attention to themselves, even going so far at to break international law. Just like the people \"rolling coal\" are extremists willing to break the law to make a spectacle out of their own views. If you don't like that, how about the people who spit on servicepeople? Or who pour paint on people that wear fur coats? The animal liberation front? Rodney Coronado?\n\n&gt;When you're right, you're right. I could not agree more. I would, in fact, think more of them for doing so. My only objection is they do not KNOW they are voting against their best interest, thus the \"gullible\" part. Thinking Trump will bring back coal jobs, thinking the EPA is a job killer, etc. Some even think he won't take away obamacare, despite him repeating it loudly and often.\n\nSo we've gone from \"voting against their own interests\" to \"voting blindly\".

I don&amp;#39;t claim that any of the characteristics you claim are mutually exclusive with &amp;quot;good&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;m simply pointing out that you are happy to paint with a broad brush when it comes to conservatives, to point out characteristics that some have and draw simplistic conclusions about them all from those, but then you turn around and admit that some liberals share the same characteristics...and refuse to draw the same conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You have not given me the equivalents of libtard or cuck. I&amp;#39;ve looked at your source and have not found equivalents. Of course there will be people who insult on both sides, but the amount and specificity are important. I believe you are drawing a false equivalency between the two camps. You&amp;#39;ve also not shown me anything equivalent to rolling coal on the liberal side. See Shepherd is an incredible stretch, seeing that they are not trying to enrage republicans, and are in fact operating globally antagonizing russian/japanese/whatever vessels and do not care about the country. Absolutely not equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the only thing you&amp;#39;ll accept is an exact equivalent of a given insult, google &amp;quot;republitard&amp;quot; (yes, a word people use).

And yes, I DID give you an equivalent to rolling coal. Sea shepherd. You claim they&amp;#39;re not trying to enrage republicans, but so what? They are extremist liberals, doing everything they can to draw attention to themselves, even going so far at to break international law. Just like the people &amp;quot;rolling coal&amp;quot; are extremists willing to break the law to make a spectacle out of their own views. If you don&amp;#39;t like that, how about the people who spit on servicepeople? Or who pour paint on people that wear fur coats? The animal liberation front? Rodney Coronado?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#39;re right, you&amp;#39;re right. I could not agree more. I would, in fact, think more of them for doing so.
