To illustrate further, I think that when people heard &amp;#39;My beautiful dark twisted fantasy&amp;#39; from Kanye West, they also knew immediately that it was gonna be a classic of Hip-Hop.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc2o4zh", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5mcsy0/cmv_rock_is_not_dead_but_definitely_getting_old/dc2o4zh/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483736445.0, "author_flair_text": "17\u2206", "created_utc": 1483707645.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 9, "name": "t1_dc31g25", "id": "dc31g25", "parent_id": "t1_dc2md75", "depth": 1, "children": ["dc31g25", "dc2xiqp", "dc3i8kv", "dc2xhr9", "dc2yt7z"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc2md75", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ACrusaderA", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5mcsy0", "score": 58, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "This is true if someone doesn't listen to new bands.\n\nThere are many songs from the last 10 years that I could easily place on a top50 list. \n\nSure a healthy portion of that list would be classics like \"Dream On\" and \"Paradise City\" and \"Rock 'n Roll All Night\", or things like \"Come as You Are\" or \"Enter Sandman\".\n\nBut if the point of the list was to make a list of 50 songs to listen to in order to become acclimated with Rock; then you have to include newer songs like \"The Pretender\" (2007) \"Dog Days are Over\" (2009) as well as those older ones because you have to show people what has remained consistent for the last 60 years.\n\nIf the point is to make a list of the greatest rock songs of all time, then you can't do that.

Sheer ammount of music being produced, there is more music on the market than ever before, so it's easy to get overwhelmed by it all, and get caught in staying in your own little corner.\n\n2. The older artists are maturing. As bands get older their music matures (in most cases). If you're listening to the same bands yeah their music is gonna get more mature, and honestly a bit more intellectual.  Perfect example for me is one of my favorite bands, Bad Religion. You listen to their older albums and newer albums and they change from simply angry punks to far more polished angry, contemplative, and musically creative punks. To me it's a good thing but it did loose some of the sheer passion. That's not a bad thing, but also its a change in pace. If you still want that energy though you just have to look in younger different bands.\n\n3. The challenges of today are drastically different than they were in the past. Kids today are singing about, and angry about different things than they were in the past. SO if you are listening for anger and rebellion against massacres in cambodia you aren't gonna find it. Instead you're gonna have rebellion against suburban culture and global warming.\n\n&gt;I mean: why would someone who was raised by The Clash, Black Flag and Metallica in the early 80's be shocked by any rock released nowadays?\n\nThey probably wouldn't be, but at the same time, were you shocked by the song makin whoopee, or johnny b good? Rock (and more music in general) is a snapshot of the feelings of a specific time and place it's made.

As bands get older their music matures (in most cases). If you&amp;#39;re listening to the same bands yeah their music is gonna get more mature, and honestly a bit more intellectual.  Perfect example for me is one of my favorite bands, Bad Religion. You listen to their older albums and newer albums and they change from simply angry punks to far more polished angry, contemplative, and musically creative punks. To me it&amp;#39;s a good thing but it did loose some of the sheer passion. That&amp;#39;s not a bad thing, but also its a change in pace. If you still want that energy though you just have to look in younger different bands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenges of today are drastically different than they were in the past. Kids today are singing about, and angry about different things than they were in the past. SO if you are listening for anger and rebellion against massacres in cambodia you aren&amp;#39;t gonna find it. Instead you&amp;#39;re gonna have rebellion against suburban culture and global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I mean: why would someone who was raised by The Clash, Black Flag and Metallica in the early 80&amp;#39;s be shocked by any rock released nowadays?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They probably wouldn&amp;#39;t be, but at the same time, were you shocked by the song makin whoopee, or johnny b good? Rock (and more music in general) is a snapshot of the feelings of a specific time and place it&amp;#39;s made. Look at American Idiot, probably the best album of the first decade of the 20th century (also probably the last decade of the album).

Rock music was really born out of blues and borrows most of it's musical identity from blues progressions and scales. The challenge is, there's only so much you can do with power chords and 1-4-5 progressions--once you've mixed up all the possible changes and played with all your pedal effects there isn't much place else to do. In this sense, rock music is already very, very old. \n\nBut I think we are seeing a branching off within 'rock' music and new forms of what might be considered part of the broader rock genre are doing very well. Hybrid styles like indie rock, folk rock, progressive rock, &amp; funk rock are seeing a tremendous resurgence. There's more music available than ever before and a lot of it is really, really good.

The challenge is, there&amp;#39;s only so much you can do with power chords and 1-4-5 progressions--once you&amp;#39;ve mixed up all the possible changes and played with all your pedal effects there isn&amp;#39;t much place else to do. In this sense, rock music is already very, very old. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I think we are seeing a branching off within &amp;#39;rock&amp;#39; music and new forms of what might be considered part of the broader rock genre are doing very well.

I went into this thinking 'oh man there are tons of big bands', only to realize once I hit the most recent decade they were mostly holdouts from the previous (but after writing all that I wasn't gonna back down). But to my credit most of those guys really came into their own in the later 2000s. *Sound of Silver* is a fucking masterpiece and that was 2007 (and technically all of their albums were 2005 or later). Black Keys really only had one album prior to 2005. I dont' really listen to Muse, but I was under the impression that their stuff from the later 2000s was better. And *Illinoise* was 2005 :P (but Sufjan had good albums after that, including in 2015). I think MGMT's first two albums will go down as great (from 2007 and 2010).

I will agree that this year was weak in terms of rock though, I also didn't really listen to much music last year as well. But 2015 had *Carrie and Lowell*, Father John Misty's new album, *Phosphorescent Blues* by Punch Brothers is awesome (and Chris won a Grammy for his album with Edgar Meyer in 2014), Deerhunter put out a great release, Tame Impala had a popular album. I was personally a big fan of FIDLAR's release, as well as the Frights' new album (which was produced by the guy from FIDLAR). I absolutely adored Chon's new album (but that won't get any traction). Again, a lot of these are bands that have been around. But I think there are a number of bands who are still under the radar that you'll realize are great once they come into their own. I highly doubt you listened to *The Big Come Up* when it debuted (if you did good for you, but most people didn't hear of the Black Keys for years after that). Its hard to say what will be big by 2020, but I see bands like Modern Baseball and The Front Bottoms more and more in the mainstream. Look at festival billings like (Bonnaroo)[https://www.bonnaroo.com/past-lineups/], a more rock-oriented festival, and you'll see bands rise and fall. The artists at the top earned it. And for some of the more modern bands, you can see their trajectory based on billing position at different festivals. (Side note: you can also see the downward trajectory of the jam bands I mentioned in my original post as festivals get more and more popular). **It will pretty much always look like the bands at the top have been around for a while, and why is that? Because they have!** The more exposure we have to music, the harder it is for a band to become an overnight success (a concept I just made up, feel free to prove me wrong), but things take time. You'll see who the big players are in 10 years' time.\n\nThere are also a lot of good albums within the last few years that aren't exactly 'accessible' (which is why I brought up *Trout Mask Replica*). Swans had a number of albums in the past few years, including this year. GY!BE had a new album in 2015. Nick Cave's new album tops a lot of charts for 2016.

I got lost in my own writing.\n\n\n\n&gt;if you asked a a group of rock fan to create a top50 of rock best songs for someone who has never listened to rock, would there be many songs from bands created in the last 10 year?\n\nThis seems to be the crux of your question. Long story short there are a number of songs a lot of people WOULD put in the list, but the problem is that there is a huge back-catalog of rock which has garnered extreme popular momentum that is hard to compete with. It also depends on how you define rock and how we interact with music in modern times.\n\n--- I want to make an aside really quick and say that this ENTIRE thing is from a white-centric view. Not saying that black people don't listen to rock, but there has been a cultural divide when it comes to music that goes back to, well, forever. I am ignoring funk, jazz, r&amp;b, and rap on purpose in this argument, but let it be known: \"black\" music (sorry if that comes off as racist, I'm just using the label to make a sweeping argument) such as jazz, soul, r&amp;b, rap, reggae, house, have always had a very large impact on pop music (and rock itself). Your argument is effectively: black music is pervading and taking away listeners from white music (hey, thats what they said when Rock n Roll was originally started!, full circle?). But that has ALWAYS been the case, and its no different now. ---\n\n(feel free to skip to the child post where I talk about modern music, I got lost explaining bullshit)\n\nTo give this all some scope, the distorted guitar sounds of Jackie Brenston's 1951 song *Rocket 88* is said to have ushered in Rock and Roll (which will be my benchmark for the beginnings of 'Rock'). So right off the back, we are working with 65 years of Rock history; we can't even pick one song from each year to fit in this 'top 50'. But I doubt any songs come into the list until around 1956 when Elvis recorded *Heartbreak Hotel* so that narrows it down to 60 years. Still a lot of time, and again begs the question of how we are defining 'Rock'. A lot of songs from the early era of Rock (1955-1965), better known as Rock n' Roll, could potentially make the list due to their sheer importance to the genre (Elvis, Buddy Holly, Bo Diddley, Everly Brothers, Beatlemania etc). But then we leave out tons of slots for things to come.\n\nThings changed around 1965 when the Beatles took LSD, the Rolling Stones broke out, the Who started making music, Pink Floyd emerged from an acidic pool in the earth. I'm going to lump together 1965-1975 to keep with the theme of decades. This is the decade of 'Rock'. Music of teeny-bopper past has matured into politically-aware, hard rocking art. This decade brought us Jimi Hendrix, Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Neil Young (who transcends and shapes Rock throughout his career to current day), The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Sabbath, CCR, Bowie, etc. The top 5 songs of 1972 (Billboard Hot 100) are by: Roberta Flack, Gilbert O'Sullivan, Don McLean, Harry Nillson, and Sammy Davis Jr. ROCKIN'! Sure Don McLean sang about the state of Rock or whatever, big whoop. It ain't top 50. You know what single debuted in 1972 that didn't even chart on Billboard's year-end Hot 100? The \"greatest rock song ever\": *Stairway to Heaven*! (Though *Zeppelin IV* peaked at 2 on the US charts and #1 on the British in 1971). But this is probably more of an argument of why you can't really look at the Hot 100 chart for great rock songs.\n\nBut what is there to say about the lesser known 'top 50' songs of all time that debuted in the \"Decade of Rock\": such as, say, Velvet Underground's 1967 masterpiece *Heroin*? The underground (woo puns) scene was rampant with great bands, that were cosmically important for the shape of rock to come. This decade also brought the likes of The Stooges, MC5, tons of other proto-punk bands that will come into play in the next few decades (not to mention skinhead, ska, etc that would play a big role in English punk). There was also Zappa, Captain Beefheart, and other such weirdos. Depends who you ask, but a fairly large population will put *Trout Mask Replica* as one of the greatest rock albums of all time (if not the memey-ist). It is a HIGHLY acclaimed album, and opens up the floor for a point I want to make later.\n\nAnother major development of the 'decade of rock' was Prog Rock. Experimental shit was going down in the relative mainstream with bands like Pink Floyd, Yes, Genesis, King Crimson, etc. And some more underground stuff like Camel. I think it is fair to say that a lot of people would put a few Pink Floyd songs in the top 50, and probably a King Crimson song (*Schizoid Man*), but it was a large large movement that had a lot of mainstream and underground support. But the disparity between *Echoes* by Pink Floyd and, say, *That'll Be The Day* by Buddy Holly is massive. Both Rock. So are Elton John, Bowie, Jimi, Nirvana, Radiohead, and Animal Collective. All different, all Rock, all in the top 50.\n\nSo this nicely brings us to the next decade: 1975-1985. This is also the \"Decade of Disco\". For purposes of argument, I will NOT be counting Disco as Rock. It is (kinda in a possibly sorta racist sense) akin to pop-rap and pop-electronic music of today. Most of those big prog-rock bands from the early 70s broke up (or stayed together) and became shitty pop-rock acts (sorry, Phil). There were also grandiose acts with prog influences that made big hits (ELO, Rush, Styx). Acts like Elton John were turning more towards pop. There was also Queen (*A Night At The Opera* debuted 1975), Talking Heads, Van Halen, AC/DC got big, Tom Petty met the Heartbreakers, Aerosmith peaked, ZZ Top came into existence (I doubt they'd be top 50, but they have a fighting chance), and a large handful of bands who are played on \"classic rock\" radio, but really don't deserve a spot in the top 50 (Foreigner, BTO, Bad Company, etc.). So rock was really kicking in the mainstream alongside disco. If you look at the Hot 100 (which again might not be the best metric, but it shows general trends), Disco crushes rock. And, in my opinion, mainstream rock was not all that good. At least compared to 1965-1975 and 1985-1995. Sure Queen was great, as were the Talking Heads, and AC/DC will probably make the list, but for the most part what we see as \"Rock\" was relatively huge, but not really noteworthy. And this is what a lot of people think of as \"Rock\", coked up old white guys in tight pants. It aint dying, its dead. For good reason too.\n\nThere was also the Sex Pistols, Ramones, The Clash, and other mainstream punk bands that emerged from the festering underground scene of the 'Decade of Rock'. This all matured into a vibrant punk scene of the late 70s, and early 80s that fractured into hardcore, post-punk (Joy Division will probably make the list), etc etc. It also has influences reaching into modern rock (much more influence than, for instance, Journey). There were countless punk bands during the time (Bad Brains, Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, etc.), some with moderate acclaim outside the punk circles (or so I think, I wasn't there), and a few of those guys deserve spots in the top 50. They also had a big influence on what will soon be called \"alternative rock\". There was also New Wave, combining punk, disco, surf, rock n roll, and so on to create a \"cool\" new sound. I'd count it as rock (again, massive disparity within rock).\n\nAnd then there were the kids who listened to too much Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Judas Priest who made harder, darker music that eventually turned into metal. Iron Maiden, Motorhead, etc. all emerged in the 'Decade of Disco'. I don't know too much about metal, but the scene had to be pretty damn big to result in the happenings of the 80s.\n\nWhich brings us to the next decade, 1985-1995. Hip-hop is a thing. So is Paula Abdul. Again, year-end charts are dominated by pop. Yet, here we are with more rock. There was \"hair metal\", including bands who TOTALLY deserve a spot in the top 50 like Def Leppard, Whitesnake, Ratt, etc (/s another logical conclusion to a rock style that has thankfully died). But there was also Guns N Roses, who probably make a lot of lists. There was Metallica, Slayer, and other thrash bands. There was also U2. There was alternative rock like The Smiths and (kinda) The Cure. There was Billy Idol (praise the lord). Really the late 80s should be its own thing, but I'm doing decades.\n\nThere was also grunge and pop-punk. Nirvana is going to make the list, if anything. Of course there was R.E.M., Sublime, RATM, RHCP, Primus, Pearl Jam, Weezer, Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, and countless other bands who have a fighting chance for a spot in the top 50 (and who are starting to make it onto the Classic Rock airwaves). The post- scene was flourishing and a lot of people would put Slint, Sonic Youth, and Fugazi in the top. There was, as usual, a huge underground scene. And not just in the punk world, but all over. You had jam band factions holding on to Jerry's clogged arteries along other bands like Phish, Little Feat, Widespread Panic, Allmans, moe., Leftover Salmon, etc. I assume there was a massive metal scene with songs that many would argue go into the top 50. There was shoegaze, ska came back for the third time, and a million other rock genres opened up. Technology got better, music distribution got better, music in general was VERY accessible, and there was a lot of popular influence to draw upon so if anything rock continued to grow. I'm getting sick of typing, so take my word: late 80s-90s rock was massive and massively influential to modern rock (which is still alive, btw).\n\nContinued below...", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; Holy shit im so sorry, I didn&amp;#39;t realize it was this long.

Experimental shit was going down in the relative mainstream with bands like Pink Floyd, Yes, Genesis, King Crimson, etc. And some more underground stuff like Camel. I think it is fair to say that a lot of people would put a few Pink Floyd songs in the top 50, and probably a King Crimson song (&lt;em&gt;Schizoid Man&lt;/em&gt;), but it was a large large movement that had a lot of mainstream and underground support. But the disparity between &lt;em&gt;Echoes&lt;/em&gt; by Pink Floyd and, say, &lt;em&gt;That&amp;#39;ll Be The Day&lt;/em&gt; by Buddy Holly is massive. Both Rock. So are Elton John, Bowie, Jimi, Nirvana, Radiohead, and Animal Collective. All different, all Rock, all in the top 50.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this nicely brings us to the next decade: 1975-1985. This is also the &amp;quot;Decade of Disco&amp;quot;. For purposes of argument, I will NOT be counting Disco as Rock. It is (kinda in a possibly sorta racist sense) akin to pop-rap and pop-electronic music of today. Most of those big prog-rock bands from the early 70s broke up (or stayed together) and became shitty pop-rock acts (sorry, Phil). There were also grandiose acts with prog influences that made big hits (ELO, Rush, Styx). Acts like Elton John were turning more towards pop. There was also Queen (&lt;em&gt;A Night At The Opera&lt;/em&gt; debuted 1975), Talking Heads, Van Halen, AC/DC got big, Tom Petty met the Heartbreakers, Aerosmith peaked, ZZ Top came into existence (I doubt they&amp;#39;d be top 50, but they have a fighting chance), and a large handful of bands who are played on &amp;quot;classic rock&amp;quot; radio, but really don&amp;#39;t deserve a spot in the top 50 (Foreigner, BTO, Bad Company, etc.). So rock was really kicking in the mainstream alongside disco. If you look at the Hot 100 (which again might not be the best metric, but it shows general trends), Disco crushes rock. And, in my opinion, mainstream rock was not all that good. At least compared to 1965-1975 and 1985-1995. Sure Queen was great, as were the Talking Heads, and AC/DC will probably make the list, but for the most part what we see as &amp;quot;Rock&amp;quot; was relatively huge, but not really noteworthy. And this is what a lot of people think of as &amp;quot;Rock&amp;quot;, coked up old white guys in tight pants. It aint dying, its dead. For good reason too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was also the Sex Pistols, Ramones, The Clash, and other mainstream punk bands that emerged from the festering underground scene of the &amp;#39;Decade of Rock&amp;#39;. This all matured into a vibrant punk scene of the late 70s, and early 80s that fractured into hardcore, post-punk (Joy Division will probably make the list), etc etc. It also has influences reaching into modern rock (much more influence than, for instance, Journey). There were countless punk bands during the time (Bad Brains, Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, etc.), some with moderate acclaim outside the punk circles (or so I think, I wasn&amp;#39;t there), and a few of those guys deserve spots in the top 50. They also had a big influence on what will soon be called &amp;quot;alternative rock&amp;quot;. There was also New Wave, combining punk, disco, surf, rock n roll, and so on to create a &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; new sound. I&amp;#39;d count it as rock (again, massive disparity within rock).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then there were the kids who listened to too much Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Judas Priest who made harder, darker music that eventually turned into metal. Iron Maiden, Motorhead, etc. all emerged in the &amp;#39;Decade of Disco&amp;#39;. I don&amp;#39;t know too much about metal, but the scene had to be pretty damn big to result in the happenings of the 80s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the next decade, 1985-1995. Hip-hop is a thing. So is Paula Abdul. Again, year-end charts are dominated by pop. Yet, here we are with more rock. There was &amp;quot;hair metal&amp;quot;, including bands who TOTALLY deserve a spot in the top 50 like Def Leppard, Whitesnake, Ratt, etc (/s another logical conclusion to a rock style that has thankfully died). But there was also Guns N Roses, who probably make a lot of lists. There was Metallica, Slayer, and other thrash bands. There was also U2. There was alternative rock like The Smiths and (kinda) The Cure. There was Billy Idol (praise the lord). Really the late 80s should be its own thing, but I&amp;#39;m doing decades.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was also grunge and pop-punk. Nirvana is going to make the list, if anything. Of course there was R.E.M., Sublime, RATM, RHCP, Primus, Pearl Jam, Weezer, Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, and countless other bands who have a fighting chance for a spot in the top 50 (and who are starting to make it onto the Classic Rock airwaves). The post- scene was flourishing and a lot of people would put Slint, Sonic Youth, and Fugazi in the top. There was, as usual, a huge underground scene. And not just in the punk world, but all over. You had jam band factions holding on to Jerry&amp;#39;s clogged arteries along other bands like Phish, Little Feat, Widespread Panic, Allmans, moe., Leftover Salmon, etc. I assume there was a massive metal scene with songs that many would argue go into the top 50. There was shoegaze, ska came back for the third time, and a million other rock genres opened up. Technology got better, music distribution got better, music in general was VERY accessible, and there was a lot of popular influence to draw upon so if anything rock continued to grow. I&amp;#39;m getting sick of typing, so take my word: late 80s-90s rock was massive and massively influential to modern rock (which is still alive, btw).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Continued below...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc3bdbc", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5mcsy0/cmv_rock_is_not_dead_but_definitely_getting_old/dc3bdbc/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483765230.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483736430.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mcsy0", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mcsy0", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mcsy0", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mcsy0", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mcsy0", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mcsy0", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc3hp69", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Galious", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc38k6e", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "To be honest I wasn't really targetting Artic Monkeys when I made my comment.
