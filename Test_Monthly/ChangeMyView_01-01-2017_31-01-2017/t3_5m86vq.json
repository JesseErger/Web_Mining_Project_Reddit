There have been some pretty good studies showing better results from acupuncture and antihistamines than antihistamines alone and and than \"sham acupuncture\" and histamines alone.  Statistically significant and all that.\n\nI for one believe that a lot of this has to do with the modality of care that goes on in alternative medicines - e.g. the stress factors are so profound and so is impact of real human care.  We have strong evidence already that health outcomes are influenced pretty seriously by patient _experience_ - everything from duration of appt to waiting room experience.  Is that placebo?  Kinda / sorta.  What is _for sure_ is that you're going to experience care much more greatly in most alternative settings than you do in the current medical environments of western hospitals and doctors office.  IF you believe that human care impacts things like pain, stress etc. then the alternatives currently do a far better job on these dimensions and we'd expect those impacts to bear out in health results.\n\nPlacebo is fascinating and understanding what causes it will likely lead to types of interventions that we no longer call \"placebo\".  E.G. we've now had studies showing that actual _surgeries_ are showing benefits from he placebo affect, not to mention a shit-ton of medicines that past placebo studies and double blind.  It's a pretty fascinating area and especially important when we have a volume of medicines that do real harm and have really truly marginal return on cost or through efficacy.

(not that placebo has a great mechanical understanding, but it is our current placeholder word so we&amp;#39;ll go with it!).  There have been some pretty good studies showing better results from acupuncture and antihistamines than antihistamines alone and and than &amp;quot;sham acupuncture&amp;quot; and histamines alone.  Statistically significant and all that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I for one believe that a lot of this has to do with the modality of care that goes on in alternative medicines - e.g. the stress factors are so profound and so is impact of real human care.  We have strong evidence already that health outcomes are influenced pretty seriously by patient &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; - everything from duration of appt to waiting room experience.
