The permit holder started firing, and the killer ran out of the store. Rockdale County Sheriff Eric Levett said: \u201cI believe that if Mr. Scott did not return fire at the suspect, then more of those customers would have [been] hit by a gun[shot]. . . . So, in my opinion he saved other lives in that store.\u201d*\n\n*\u2014 Chicago, April 2015: An Uber driver who had just dropped off a fare \u201cshot and wounded a gunman [Everardo Custodio] who opened fire on a crowd of people.\u201d Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Barry Quinn praised the driver for \u201cacting in self-defense and in the defense of others.\u201d \u2014 Philadelphia, Pa., March 2015: A permit holder was walking by a barber shop when he heard shots fired. He quickly ran into the shop and shot the gunman to death. Police Captain Frank Llewellyn said, \u201cI guess he saved a lot of people in there.\u201d \u2014 Darby, Pa., July 2014: Convicted felon Richard Plotts killed a hospital caseworker and shot the psychiatrist that he was scheduled to meet with. Fortunately, the psychiatrist was a concealed-handgun permit holder and was able to critically wound Plotts. Plotts was still carrying 39 bullets and could have shot many other people.*\n\n*\u2014 Chicago, July 2014: Three gang members fired on four people who had just left a party. Fortunately, one of these four was a military serviceman with a concealed-handgun permit. He was able to return fire and wound the main attacker while keeping the others at bay. The UK\u2019s Daily Mail reported, \u201cThe night might have had a very different outcome had the incident occurred a year earlier [before Illinois\u2019s concealed-handgun law was passed].\u201d*\n\n*\u2014 Plymouth, Pa., September 2012: William Allabaugh critically wounded one man inside a restaurant and murdered a second man on the street outside. Luzerne County Assistant District Attorney Jarrett Ferentino said that without the concealed-handgun permit holder who wounded Allabaugh, \u201cwe believe that it could have been much worse that night.\u201d* \n\n*\u2014 Spartanburg, S.C., March 2012: Armed with a shotgun, Jesse Gates kicked in a door to his church. Concealed-carry permit holder Aaron Guyton drew his gun and held Gates at gun point, enabling other parishioners to disarm Gates. Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright called the churchgoers heroes. Though Gates was stopped before anyone was harmed, he was still charged with one count of kidnapping and three counts of pointing and presenting a firearm.*\n\nRead more at: http://www.nationalreview.com/article/425802/gun-free-zones-don%27t-save-lives-right-to-carry-laws-do     \n\n\n\nAlso in your edit...

I do believe both of your linked stories are very weak however.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a good read going into the recent shooting in Dallas where bystanders with guns made it impossible for officers to determine the exact number of shooters and where they were shooting from.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where are you getting that from?  Even the linked editorial which is advocating against the NRA&amp;#39;s view only said, &amp;quot;His movements made it impossible to determine the precise number of shooters.
