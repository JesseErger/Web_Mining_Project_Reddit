What you seem to be preaching is a total indifference towards feelings, and life in general, and to be controlled only by logic, which brings up some problems.\n\nLogic is quite the fluid concept, and depending on your perception, what's logical can differ vastly. For instance, you claim that seeking happiness is not logical, but if your life goal is to achieve happiness, then surely striving for it is the logical approach towards this goal. Thus, claiming what's logical and not in this context is a difficult task.\n\nFurthermore, it is of our nature to seek out happiness. We have evolved systems, biochemical algorithms which we consciously or subconsciously try to uphold, or avoid. We avoid fear and anger, because these are unpleasant feelings, and seek happiness and pleasure which we just so happens to get from things which are vital for the survival of our species: food, sex, water, sleep etc. From a biological perspective, survival is the only goal of a species, and through individual happiness this survival can be upheld.\n\nBut your individual goal may not be to get children and ensure the survival of humanity. In fact, we actively avoid the biological goal of our species with contraception and abstinence so we can enjoy the pleasure out of sex, while not suffer from the consequences. Where, in a biological perspective, is the logic of this?\n\nYour main goal may perhaps be to achieve higher academic studies, and an objective view on life. But surely what drives you towards this is pleasure, and therefore a hunt for happiness. To clarify, if said example is your goal, you will get individual pleasure out of achieving a step, or leap, towards this goal. As you come closer to achieving this goal, it will inevitably make you happy. If you didn't get any pleasure out of writing this post, or me debating your view, then none of us would be here. Let's be frank here, we both have better things to do with our time. It is out of emotions, not logic, we spend our time on reddit.\n\nOr to use your example. In your perspective, smoking is highly illogical. After all, you shorten your life for ephemeral feeling of pleasure. But for the smoker, it may very well be entirely logical, because for him the length of life is not what matters, but the amount of pleasure he gets out of what time he has. His goal is not to live long, it's to live and spend every minute he can doing what he pleases. From this perspective, the decision to smoke is very logical.\n\nWhat you overlook is that humans, and other mammals, are overwhelmingly controlled by our emotions. We are unable to control our emotions, we can only control what causes them, which is why we avoid unpleasant emotions, and seek pleasant ones. We know we cannot control our emotions, because we cannot control the biochemical algorithms which evoke the emotions, but we can learn what causes them. \n\nWhen you make a decision it is highly controlled by your current emotions.  [As this Harvard study](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jenniferlerner/files/annual_review_manuscript_june_16_final.final_.pdf) points out, our decision making process seem to be under control of our emotions. It's impossible to avoid emotions. Your decision to try to achieve complete objective logic is caused by emotional response to the thought of this goal. Thus, logic is under the control of emotions, not the other way around.\n\n &gt; Also, if your goal is happiness and something happens that makes you sad, you are gonna have a really bad time. In case your existence is driven towards being happy you might get depressed and maybe suicidal if it doesn't work. Logic and the other hand will never let you down and you don't care about your emotion anymore if you are truly logical.\n\nBut would logic really never let you down? What I think is a logical decision may fundamentally change as new information arises. Say that I make the decision to study to become a programmer because the job market offers many opportunities, and my goal with my studies would be to secure a job, then this is seemingly logical. After years of studies however, the job market has changed, and the demand for programmers has now been satisfied. The demand for teachers on the other hand, has skyrocketed, but was at the time I chose what to study very low. My point here is that if I would've been able to access a time machine, and could learn this information, then what would've seemed logical for me would change.\n\nSo logic will surely let you down, because there is no objective logic. This is good, because without illogical decisions, we cannot understand what is logical, just as without anger, sadness or fear we wouldn't be able to differentiate happiness. \n\nTo sum it all up, my main point is that logic can not be a goal, it can only be one tool of many towards your goal. What is logical in this context is not an objective concept, but instead a creation of our perspective of life, and is *under* control of, not *in* control of our emotions.
