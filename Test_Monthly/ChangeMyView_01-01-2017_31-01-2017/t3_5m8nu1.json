I don't disagree that it's easier to get ahead in life when you have the connections and financial backing of a wealthy family. That's obviously true, and anyone who would say otherwise is either lying or dense. But that's not really relevant.\n\nThe idea isn't that \"the hardest worker will reap the greatest gains.\" That's basically what you're saying, right? That in theory, if you work the hardest, you should be richer than the folks who worked less than you? It fails in two ways.\n\nFirst of all, you have to work hard, but also work smart. No, there's not a huge difference in the amount of effort between someone who's mining coal all day and an entrepreneur who manages to start up a unicorn in Silicon Valley. Maybe there's a little bit, but certainly the \"effort per dollar\" is way lower. You can flap your wings as long as you want, but you'll stay on the ground.\n\nBut second, I think more importantly, is that while it's unreasonable to expect anyone to go from growing up in poverty to private jets through hard work without a *lot* of luck, there is *definitely* room to make a net delta in your standard of living. That delta is able to continue over the course of time. For the same reason that Trump was able to get a head start, every leg up you can get at the lower levels results in increased opportunity for your children, which leads to increased opportunity for your grandchildren, etc.. If *that* system is broken (and I'll be quite honest, I can neither confirm nor deny that) you can have a case, but if you can improve your situation, which leads to generations upon generations improving their situations, that is the system working as expected. going from 0 to 10^9 isn't the expected result of capitalism, those are anomalies. It's important that those anomalies exist (and continue to exist) because that's what drives people to creativity and risk-taking, but it will never be the norm.

I don&amp;#39;t disagree that it&amp;#39;s easier to get ahead in life when you have the connections and financial backing of a wealthy family. That&amp;#39;s obviously true, and anyone who would say otherwise is either lying or dense. But that&amp;#39;s not really relevant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea isn&amp;#39;t that &amp;quot;the hardest worker will reap the greatest gains.&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s basically what you&amp;#39;re saying, right? That in theory, if you work the hardest, you should be richer than the folks who worked less than you? It fails in two ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all, you have to work hard, but also work smart. No, there&amp;#39;s not a huge difference in the amount of effort between someone who&amp;#39;s mining coal all day and an entrepreneur who manages to start up a unicorn in Silicon Valley. Maybe there&amp;#39;s a little bit, but certainly the &amp;quot;effort per dollar&amp;quot; is way lower. You can flap your wings as long as you want, but you&amp;#39;ll stay on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But second, I think more importantly, is that while it&amp;#39;s unreasonable to expect anyone to go from growing up in poverty to private jets through hard work without a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of luck, there is &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; room to make a net delta in your standard of living. That delta is able to continue over the course of time. For the same reason that Trump was able to get a head start, every leg up you can get at the lower levels results in increased opportunity for your children, which leads to increased opportunity for your grandchildren, etc.. If &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; system is broken (and I&amp;#39;ll be quite honest, I can neither confirm nor deny that) you can have a case, but if you can improve your situation, which leads to generations upon generations improving their situations, that is the system working as expected. going from 0 to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; isn&amp;#39;t the expected result of capitalism, those are anomalies. It&amp;#39;s important that those anomalies exist (and continue to exist) because that&amp;#39;s what drives people to creativity and risk-taking, but it will never be the norm. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean the system is broken, and it doesn&amp;#39;t mean the system is inherently unfair, unless the concept of progressive, generational growth is also broken.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc1npyx", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5m8nu1/cmv_it_is_impossible_to_claim_that_capitalism_is/dc1npyx/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483676425.0, "author_flair_text": "13\u2206", "created_utc": 1483647625.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m8nu1", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "name": "t1_dc2lwrr", "id": "dc2lwrr", "parent_id": "t1_dc20vhi", "depth": 1, "children": ["dc2lwrr"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc20vhi", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Djojo_Unchained", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5m8nu1", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "[relevant](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/78/b0/f1/78b0f1d3bff15808bfcfef80a7734cda.jpg)", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/78/b0/f1/78b0f1d3bff15808bfcfef80a7734cda.jpg\"&gt;relevant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc20vhi", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5m8nu1/cmv_it_is_impossible_to_claim_that_capitalism_is/dc20vhi/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483692021.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483663221.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m8nu1", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc1v4ss", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Samuelgin", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5m8nu1", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "capitalism doesn't take into account societal advantages bc that's not an inherit part of an economic system. those advantages can influence or limit a persons options or actions, but capitalism plays them all the same. if a society has a prejudice against an ethnicity, that prejudice would exist whether capitalism was in play or not. \n\nI would argue that the \"starting point in a race\" is too simplified of a metaphor. it implies that there is one path to prosperity which is a singular point and it accepts no alternatives. there are multiple paths to get to the same place and there are many many different places to go, which means the \"different starting point\" metaphor really only applies to identical people pursing identical goals in identical fashions. to get to a job in a tech field, one person might decide their route is to get a degree and jump in halfway up the ladder. someone else might have the opportunity to elect to attend a technology high school and start off in the tech field four years earlier but at a lower position.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;capitalism doesn&amp;#39;t take into account societal advantages bc that&amp;#39;s not an inherit part of an economic system. those advantages can influence or limit a persons options or actions, but capitalism plays them all the same. if a society has a prejudice against an ethnicity, that prejudice would exist whether capitalism was in play or not. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would argue that the &amp;quot;starting point in a race&amp;quot;
