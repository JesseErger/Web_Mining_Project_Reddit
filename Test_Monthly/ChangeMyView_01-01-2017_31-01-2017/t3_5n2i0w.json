What makes that difference?\n\nWe tend to want to think of ourselves as good skeptics who are constantly vigilant against deception and never willing to take a potentially hostile information source at face value, but we actually have no choice but to rely very heavily on our capacity to gauge credibility. We assume that our textbooks are pretty reliable when it comes to basic facts, because that assumption has always served us well and we just don't have the time to trace every statement of fact back to the empirical evidence and controlled experiments that supposedly ground it. We trust our doctors instead of jumping on Google and trying to diagnose ourselves all the time, because we recognize that a doctor's training and expertise is something that isn't accessible to most other people. And until very recently, we were able to trust the mainstream news media to be basically reliable and fundamentally committed to the truth most of the time.\n\nFor people like you and me, who've been dodging spammers and phishers and deceptive banner ads all our lives, most fake news is obviously fake.

In other words, a very squishy, subjective, somewhat adjustable notion of what it takes to be considered &amp;quot;capable and informed&amp;quot; is built into your view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think you&amp;#39;ll also agree that there are times when the victim of a deception is blamed for being too gullible, and other times when the deceiver is blamed instead. If you bought a stereo system from Best Buy and found out later that it was a Trump-brand knockoff dressed up to look like a Sony, we&amp;#39;d all sympathize with you and blame the store. Not so if you bought it out of the back of some guy&amp;#39;s van at the edge of the Best Buy parking lot. What makes that difference?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We tend to want to think of ourselves as good skeptics who are constantly vigilant against deception and never willing to take a potentially hostile information source at face value, but we actually have no choice but to rely very heavily on our capacity to gauge credibility. We assume that our textbooks are pretty reliable when it comes to basic facts, because that assumption has always served us well and we just don&amp;#39;t have the time to trace every statement of fact back to the empirical evidence and controlled experiments that supposedly ground it. We trust our doctors instead of jumping on Google and trying to diagnose ourselves all the time, because we recognize that a doctor&amp;#39;s training and expertise is something that isn&amp;#39;t accessible to most other people. And until very recently, we were able to trust the mainstream news media to be basically reliable and fundamentally committed to the truth most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For people like you and me, who&amp;#39;ve been dodging spammers and phishers and deceptive banner ads all our lives, most fake news is obviously fake. But you have to keep in mind that grandma is also on Facebook now. Why would she be automatically suspicious of a random news story that pops up on her feed? She never had to be suspicious of Walter Cronkite. Nobody&amp;#39;s ever given her a hard time for accepting newspaper headlines without independently verifying them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is also arguably a rising generation of younger people who are savvier than grandma in many ways, but lack basic research skills for a variety of reasons.
