Within a patriarchial system, a single person (or at least single man) institution of marriage is necessary to assure that males can pass their wealth and titles to their heirs.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we have moved towards a more republican and egalitarian system, the necessity of legitimacy and the disinheritance of bastards&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; no longer became so pressing, and indeed there is now a strong policy preference for prohibiting the abandonment or disavowal of bastards.  Such is the reason child support exists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This reasoning, moving away from an institution whose foundations lay in royalty and passage of property to male heirs, can also extend to multiple-person groupings.  If we&amp;#39;re modernizing the institution because its roots are silly, antiquated, and repulsive to a modern society where all persons are valued regardless of parentage, why not modernize it to allow unions of more than two persons?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; To be honest, nobody cared about those who were too poor and/or unimportant to have assets to pass on.  The law was not made for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; I&amp;#39;m using this term in its traditional sense to refer to a child born out of wedlock, and in particular to the &amp;quot;fatherless&amp;quot; nature of such a child.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc6l8ar", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5mux3a/cmv_connections_between_polygamous_marriage_and/dc6l8ar/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483958943.0, "author_flair_text": "315\u2206", "created_utc": 1483930143.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mux3a", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mux3a", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mux3a", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc7xyt8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "johncp727", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc7xcdr", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I can't speak for anyone other than myself, but I've already shown that my thinking did not come from a religious standpoint.

If it's really critical, you can make a simple rule, like the spouse with the lowest social security number makes the decision. Or, you could require multispouse relationships to keep end-of-life information on file.\n* multiparty custody disputes: There are already multiparty civil disputes over companies or securities, so clearly courts are capable of arbitrating disputes with more than two parties.\n\nAll of these objections sound a lot like, \"we can't do gay marriage because all of our forms have Husband and Wife on them.\" Just print new forms!\n\nPS.\n\n&gt;nationwide^1\n\nShould there be a footnote here?", "edited": 1483931484.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;much of the argument for gay marriage would &amp;quot;apply with equal force&amp;quot; to polygamous marriage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I absolutely agree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is why polygamous marriage should be legal.
