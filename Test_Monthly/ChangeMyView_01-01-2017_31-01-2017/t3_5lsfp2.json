It has been very difficult to fix, and officers tend to believe they are not playing part in casual corruption because the money they are stealing is &amp;quot;from drug traffickers and other bad people&amp;quot; despite never sending the victims to court. If we were to implement something like total asset seizure, and we implemented it poorly (which is likely, given the state of our government systems across the world), we would need to fight a very strong and very corrupt power to fix the process, and this power could possibly be totally convinced that they are doing the right thing, despite stealing billions from innocent people under the name of &amp;#39;justice.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we would need to implement this idea perfectly the first time, or we would be in a very bad spot. And it is also very unlikely we would be able to do a good job the first time because our governments in general make many errors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbyiktj", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lsfp2/cmv_punish_white_collar_crime_with_seizure_of/dbyiktj/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483505362.0, "author_flair_text": "1\u2206", "created_utc": 1483476562.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lsfp2", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbyswp1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Irish_Samurai", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5lsfp2", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "The government will never go after their own people.
