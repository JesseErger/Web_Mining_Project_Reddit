The irony of blaming irreparable political divide in America on one party or one man seems to have escaped you. I don't point this out to be rude but rather because your viewpoint is a common one. Its common to Democrats and its just as common to Republicans. We are in the habit of blaming complex longstanding problems on whichever political party we don't belong to. If you are looking for culprits for the deep divide in America, you need look no further than we the people. How often have you heard the following statement: \"He/ she is such a nice person I cannot comprehend why they vote republican/ Democrat\". I hear that one a lot. I hear it from people who think they have suddenly become a more moderate and open minded person for acknowledging that there might be positive attributes to someone on the political spectrum opposite themselves. It worries me to see how genuine they are in their surprise. There is a moral divide in the public conscious as well as a political one. Donald Trump didn't put that there, that has been there for years. As I reflect back on this past election there are a few things that stick out to me that point to Donald Trump as a symptom more than a cause. \n\nI think its worth pointing out that Trump and Hillary had spectacularly low public approval. Both had lower public approval than any candidates in U.S history. What this means is a lot of republicans voted for Donald Trump despite the fact that they couldn't stand him. The republican camp could accurately be divided between Trump supporters and Hillary detractors. Trump didn't lead a lot of his voting base. He didn't inspire or excite them. He had his ardent followers but they were by no means a majority in the Republican camp. I frankly do not believe Trump has ever held the political capital he would need to irreversibly widen the political divide but rather he exploited an already existing divide.\n\nWhat I observed looking back on the election is there was a definite shift in republican voters that doesn't really get talked about. Right after the Republican primary when it was confirmed that Trump would be the nominee I would have been comfortable saying that less than half of the republicans I knew were going to vote for him. That changed dramatically when it became clear that whoever won this election was going to decide who would be in the majority on the Supreme court. Suddenly there stopped being anti Trump republicans. If anything the public realization of this became the most important unifying event for the Republican party. This was especially true for evangelical voters. Its hard to understand the magnitude of how this shifted their viewpoint. No longer were they voting on a four year presidency, they were voting on several decades of supreme court control. This I believe to be especially compelling. No one had to tell republicans that a supreme court picked by Hillary would be a tool to further the democratic agenda no matter who held control of congress or the presidency. They already believed that. No one needed to whip them into a frenzy over nor suggest that this would be a major problem. Likewise, no one had to tell the democrats the same thing either. The moment that the supreme court justices came into the picture is the moment this election became serious. \n\nThe implications of this point to a deeper political divide. The supreme courts weren't about policy. Both sides were afraid that generally speaking the other side would control the courts for decades. Unlike the presidency, this issue wasn't about immediate policies but rather the impact that the other party would have decades down the line. That is the greatest exemplification of how deep the political divide already was in America. Conservatives and Liberals; not the politicians but the lay peoples like you and me do not trust each other to uphold justice in the highest court of the land. Political divide like that; cannot be achieved by one man. That is the result of long standing and well rooted political dysfunction. \n\n We have come to expect the worst of each other.

I could honestly tell you most expected Hillary felt that way about them. When the \"grab them by the pussy\" tape leaked, its shock value was undermined in part by speculation as to how long the Hillary's campaign had been holding on to that juicy little tidbit. \n\nMy point isn't that any of these reactions were right or justified but rather they are beyond the abilities of one man to produce. How deeply cynicism and mistrust has pervaded political dialogue between everyday Americans is an accomplishment that is further beyond Donald Trump than even his wall. If we want to see it fixed there has to be a commitment to examining the problem with empathy for those we disagree with fundamentally. We must apply introspection to what we do individually to further the divide and what we are and are not willing to do to change that. \n\nH.L Mencken once said that democracy is the belief that the people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.
