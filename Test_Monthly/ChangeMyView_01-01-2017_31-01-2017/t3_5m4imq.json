That could be true but would you rather need a seatbelt and have one or need one and not have it ?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Terrorism&amp;#39;s danger to civilization isn&amp;#39;t defined in deaths or even money necessarily. It&amp;#39;s true threat is to disrupt our way of life and we have no remedy for that. We could all argue about how much any or even all terrorist attacks cost in the long run but the danger is how it impedes or impinges upon the system that supplies the money to those that make the most. We&amp;#39;re protected, to some degree, by the proxy of being somebody&amp;#39;s business interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Terrorism isn&amp;#39;t really played up or overblown. I mean, it depends on what you watch and where you get your news from, right ? If you watch CNN all day and night, you&amp;#39;re bound to see a story here and there about terrorism. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point of terrorism is actually rather genius : Use the media to multiply your impact by orders of magnitude. Works like a charm. Real terrorism isn&amp;#39;t designed to be a bloodbath : It&amp;#39;s supposed to act as a means to achieving a very clear end. When done right, very few people should die but the act will be on the world&amp;#39;s lips. That&amp;#39;s the idea. Terrorism loses its impact when it happens all the time or people start to associate it with any particular cohort of the global population. When it becomes &amp;quot;their&amp;quot; problem...well, then it&amp;#39;s worthless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t kid yourself about this : there is nothing at all that the people we currently call terrorists would love more than to sneak a dirty bomb into a Steeler&amp;#39;s game. Making sure that that doesn&amp;#39;t happen costs money. It took one guy with a plan and 19 other true believers to change the world. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc0x1wv", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5m4imq/cmv_terrorism_is_much_less_of_an_issue_than_we/dc0x1wv/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483634085.0, "author_flair_text": "7\u2206", "created_utc": 1483605285.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m4imq", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc17ruw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BenIncognito", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5m4imq", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Sorry zarmesan, your submission has been removed: \n\n&gt; Submission Rule E\\. \"Only post if you are willing to have a conversation with those who reply to you, and are available to do so within 3 hours after posting.

Unlike car accidents which are very predictable, terrorism is a lot more like earthquakes where you can&amp;#39;t really tell when they are going to come, but you can do a pretty good job of predicting the overall frequency of various magnitude attacks.  Larger attacks are rarer. An earthquake that is 10 times as powerful is 10 times as rare and terrorism follows the same laws.  So while we have many times more attacks on the scale of 100&amp;#39;s of deaths than 1000&amp;#39;s of deaths there is a very quantifiable threat of another attack in the 1000&amp;#39;s of deaths or even of a biological attack which could hit 10,000&amp;#39;s or much much more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc3ktdl", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5m4imq/cmv_terrorism_is_much_less_of_an_issue_than_we/dc3ktdl/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483776762.0, "author_flair_text": "73\u2206", "created_utc": 1483747962.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc3e1y1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "zarmesan", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc0u3sr", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I see what you're saying about the fear component, but my point is that the majority of terrorists attacks ARE done by our own tribe and that there has never been any other situation close to 9/11 in scope, especially done by 'Islamic Extremists.'", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see what you&amp;#39;re saying about the fear component, but my point is that the majority of terrorists attacks ARE done by our own tribe and that there has never been any other situation close to 9/11 in scope, especially done by &amp;#39;Islamic Extremists.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc3e1y1", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5m4imq/cmv_terrorism_is_much_less_of_an_issue_than_we/dc3e1y1/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483768230.0, "author_flair_text": "2\u2206", "created_utc": 1483739430.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc0u3sr", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AnythingApplied", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5m4imq", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Your only argument seems to be that the amount of deaths is relatively low.
