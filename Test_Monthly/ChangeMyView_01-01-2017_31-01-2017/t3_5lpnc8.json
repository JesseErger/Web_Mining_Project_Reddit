Effort is also measured. \n\nThat's extremely dependent on what grade you are talking about. Like I said, different places measure them using different ratios of components. What I should have emphasized is that because of that fact, grades are not a reliable indicator of intelligence because the determinant of the grade is most often not the person to whom the grade is applied, but the person who is teaching. Subjectivity is the bane of all discussions about what is a good metric for measurement of anything, and grades are rife with it. \n\n&gt;I am convinced that for the same or similar effort level, a more intelligent student is always going to get a better grade.\n\nWhat if that grade is an A+? Teachers determine that X amount of effort is equivalent to an \"exceptional\" grade, and as I'm sure you see it would be impossible for a more intelligent student to get a higher grade despite their effort. What this also brings up is that grades are most frequently measured by applying an individual \"score\" as it were to a subset of average scores of that individual's peers. In other words, in higher grades many places give out grades based on your performance applied to a curve of your classmates (or for standard testing, people your age or even just people who took the test). So if your grade is an accurate measure of your intelligence, that would mean logically that your intelligence is essentially dependent on how intelligent everyone else in your group is. \n\nTo take it a step further and borrow a cliche, if everyone is exceptional does that mean no one is? Does the person who is last in a group of 100 brilliant people really have a low intelligence as their grade would imply, or is it still entirely relative? \n\n&gt;Likewise, I think students who have comprehension of the subject matter and actually put effort into their project yet got a bad grade are also few and far between.\n\nAre we excluding grades for skill based things, like art or music? Because in areas of study like those, there are countless people who study and understand the information, but simply lack the ability to convert that information into physical expression. The comprehension is there, but their grades will not reflect it. Are you excluding this entire group as part of \"intelligence\"? \n\n&gt;In order to perform well under pressure, it is required to know what you're doing.\n\nAgain, I disagree fundamentally. It is easier to perform under pressure when you know what to do but there again are countless instances of people who know exactly what to do under pressure and simply cannot, just as there are many examples of people who don't know what to do but are able to remain composed and because of that ability can improvise a successful solution to the issue. Composure and intelligence are not directly related either, as plenty of intelligent people lose their composure regularly. \n\n&gt;Confident idiots aren't really performing, they're just failing.\n\nThat's my point though, if confidence gives you composure and the \"intelligent\" person doesn't have that, the confident idiot may not fail at all. It's not at all unheard of for people with demonstrable comprehension to do poorly on tests because of anxiety while people with measurably less comprehension do better because they don't have the same anxiety. That grade then doesn't reflect their \"intelligence\", only their ability to sit composed in a room for a timed period and answer questions. \n\n&gt; I don't see what you're getting at except that most teacher don't make good tests, which is also not true.\n\nDo you have data to back that up? Because fundamentally it's easier to write a bad test than a good one, which makes it infinitely more likely that the majority would produce poor tests compared to ones that adequately measure something as complex as intelligence. That's why our currently accepted metric, the IQ test, has to be administered and interpreted by professionals to be considered even remotely accurate, and even then people don't think it's that reliable a predictor in most cases.  \n\n&gt;I'm not using intelligence and skill interchangeably. I the ability to learn and apply knowledge IS a skill.\n\nYou claim to not be using them interchangeably, then state you consider them to be synonymous and thus interchangeable? \n\nAnother issue I've briefly touched on is that if grades are to be considered a metric of intelligence, then you have to also accept that intelligence doesn't exist as a single entity. In other words, people are more adept at learning certain types of material than others. If you disagree with that, then it would be impossible to argue that someone who gets straight A's in math is intelligent, even though they get D's in spanish. By extension of that logic, you cannot exclude music and art as \"branches\" of intelligence, and I've gone over the issues with that above. \n\n&gt;Your argument about the geniuses is an example of denying the antecedent, which is a fallacy. Your argument regarding gaining knowledge vs. intelligence has the same issue.\n\nI understand what a fallacy is, and I'm familiar with people claiming a statement is such without actually understanding what that means. I'd greatly appreciate if you would explain how you are interpreting that particular piece of my comment, so I might understand where the problem lies because as I'm looking at it there is no such fallacy. Interestingly, your claim seems at this point to be a fallacy itself (argument from fallacy).\n\n&gt;As for your conclusion, I think the terms speak for themselves. \n\nIf they did that, then we wouldn't be having this discussion. If you really want to play the fallacy game (and I do not, this is why) then this argument is proof by assertion. I've given reasons why they don't work for this argument and why the confusion that stems from that leads to an inability to truly solve the dilemma you posed, and your response was \"I think they explain themselves, so I'm not going to\". I consider that inadequate. Hopefully you see why by leaving them the way you have, we will continue to turn this circle until one of us gives up without having changed either persons mind.

Confident idiots aren&amp;#39;t really performing, they&amp;#39;re just failing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure &amp;quot;applying&amp;quot; qualifies under the broader term &amp;quot;using&amp;quot;. In this context they&amp;#39;re basically synonymous. I just use the term &amp;quot;using&amp;quot; because I&amp;#39;ve had some pretty strange tests before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for your third part about mastery, I don&amp;#39;t see what you&amp;#39;re getting at except that most teacher don&amp;#39;t make good tests, which is also not true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not using intelligence and skill interchangeably. I the ability to learn and apply knowledge IS a skill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your argument about the geniuses is an example of denying the antecedent, which is a fallacy. Your argument regarding gaining knowledge vs. intelligence has the same issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for your conclusion, I think the terms speak for themselves. They work under most definitions I&amp;#39;ve heard of, including the ones you provided.

Intelligence however has no link to performance under pressure, other than the former can often give you confidence which will help with the latter. But you don't need intelligence to be confident. Surely most people have encountered many others in their daily life who are confident and idiots. \n\n2) Use previously applied knowledge in new ways.\nThis is a flawed statement.

There are exceptions to it being useful if the novel creation is sufficiently difficult to recreate, which is to say there are plenty of inventions and such that serve no real purpose and may not require terrific skill but the time and effort required to produce them is so high people consider the creator to be a genius at their craft. \n\n&gt;Gaining lots of knowledge is required to be an intelligent person.\n\nThis hinges entirely on how you define intelligence.

Essentially, a grade is a prediction that a student's performance on the assessment will reflect their performance in a real world task (i.e. outside of education/training contexts). In other words, assessments should be proxies for useful, valuable abilities in the real world. When I design assessments, I have two main requirements to meet:\n\n**That the assessment is valid:**\n\n* *Internal validity:* Does the assessment measure what you intend it to or is it inadvertently testing some other ability? e.g. Asking students to select the correct solution to a problem but actually only assessing their ability to match synonyms and other cues between the question/prompt and the correct answer. This is more difficult to avoid than it sounds. A good test of internal validity is how much coaching and training students in assessment technique can boost their performance. If the boost is high, then the assessment more than likely has validity issues.\n\n* *External validity:* Does achieving a grade on this assessment correlate with the student's abilities outside of the educational context/in the real world? Assessment in education and training settings is highly artificial and rarely reflects real world conditions. An externally valid assessment must prove that students perform equally well or poorly in the real world as they do under the assessment conditions. This is actually the most difficult criterion to achieve.\n\n**That the assessment is reliable:**\n\nHow consistent are the grades that the assessment awards to students? i.e. If the same student took a similar test again, would s/he achieve a similar grade? Assuming that I'm going to assess cohorts of students year after year, I have to design new assessments that, no matter how many times a student is assessed, the results are consistent.\n\nHere's a striking example of how even large, supposedly high quality assessment specialist companies can get it very wrong and that they often don't own up to it:  [**Mute the Messenger:** *When Dr. Walter Stroup showed that Texas\u2019 standardized testing regime is \ufb02awed, the testing company struck back.*] (https://www.texasobserver.org/walter-stroup-standardized-testing-pearson/) I don't intend to single out Pearson Education here. The others; ETS, McGraw-Hill, Cambridge, et. al. all have issues with the validity and reliability of their assessments and they're less than forthcoming about it.\n\nOK, that's assessment in general. Then we have the idea of intelligence to address. A widely accepted but rather fuzzy definition of intelligence is that a person has well developed higher-order thinking skills, e.g. analytical and critical thinking skills. Lauren Resnick offers these characteristics:\n\n\"Higher order thinking\u2026\n\n* is non-algorithmic. That is, the path of action is not fully specified in advance.\n* tends to be complex.

For high school courses, homework/project based university courses and \"easy\" courses, I probably would agree with you most of the time.\n\nLearning is the result of training and \"intelligence\" (where I define intelligence as the ability to learn from training). It's a bit more complicated than this because training and intelligence (under this definition) can influence one another, but you get the general idea. Assuming grades accurately measure what you have learned (which is not always true), then, sure, grades are the result of sufficient &amp; efficient training and intelligence. But your claim is that grades *measure* intelligence *if you care about them*. I would agree with the first claim, but not the latter claim for a few reasons. \n\nFirstly, if you care about grades, it does not follow that you will put in efficient training. A person can deeply care about achieving something, but go about it the wrong way because they are uninformed of which type of training is best. This would be the result of a lack of *knowledge* (specifically a lack of knowledge of what kinds of training suits them), rather than a lack of intelligence. Of course, schools should attempt to provide students with the most efficient learning methods, but this is often not the case. Different people learn better through different training methods (e.g. some students learn better through lectures and social engagement, whereas I learn better through deeply reading course text for long periods of time in solitude), but universities often only promote one type of strategy, and it is often not immediately clear to an individual student which strategy works best for them as an individual. Learning which type of training suits you best definitely *is* partially the result of some virtuous character traits, but intelligence is not the only such trait.\n\nSecondly, if you care about grades, it does not follow that you will put in sufficient training. A person can care about a good while simultaneously not putting in sufficient work to achieve that good, but this is not necessarily indicative of a lack of intelligence. This could be the result of lack of time because of other obligations, weak will, etc. Lack of time obviously is *not* the result of lack of intelligence. For a trivial example of weak will: a person might have a really strong desire to quit smoking but they do not put in the work to do so because they have weak will. Now, having a weak will certainly is a bad thing, but it is not the same thing as a lack of intelligence (not under the definition of \"intelligence given above). \n\nThirdly, what exactly do you mean by \"measure intelligence\"? Measure implies that there's more than one person which we are comparing, so I'm going to assume you mean something like: if two students cared about grades, then any difference in grades between those two individuals would proportionally reflect their difference in intelligence. Ignoring the two issues that I just raised about this, this is still somewhat of an issue because one student might care more than the other (even though both of them still care about their grades). Therefore, difference in grades might reflect difference in caring rather than difference in intelligence.\n\nWith all of these considerations in mind, I would say that your view should move from \n\n&gt; Grades measure intelligence if (a) you actually care about them\n\nto something like \n\n&gt; Grades measure intelligence among a group of students if (a) the grades accurately measure what they have learned, (b) the students put in an *equal* amount of training, and (c) the students put in equally efficient training.\n\nBut even this is problematic because it's not clear how we can tell if two students put in equally efficient training given that what counts as efficient for one student is not necessarily what's efficient for another. Ignoring this minor complication, I would say it is reasonable to proceed from your own view to this one. It seems as though you have already conceded (a) in your OP, so I would say that you should add (b) and (c).
