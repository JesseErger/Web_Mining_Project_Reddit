Or that *anyone* ought to do something about it, necessarily. Republicans tend to place a LOT of faith in the free market and in private institutions. It's likely that they think the solution to the mental health problem is for people to attend church more, get more involved in the community, or donate to private charities that provide mental health services. \n\nI suspect that there are two reasons why Republicans don't back legislation that would address gun violence or mental health care:\n\n1) They don't believe that there's any possibility that a policy-based solution would help in any way, due to their mistrust of government and faith in free markets, and\n\n2) While I rarely hear this spoken aloud, I think if they're honest, they believe that having the freedom to own and carry guns is worth the lives lost to gun violence. If the cost of their ability to carry concealed and shoot their AR-15 on the weekends is that some strangers die every so often because a mentally unstable person legally purchases a gun, I think maybe they're okay with that deep down.

It really seem like mental health is just used as a distraction until the media buzz about a shooting calms down so that conservatives can keep their guns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I largely agree with you here, I think you&amp;#39;re ignoring a very real possibility: Republicans pointing out that there&amp;#39;s a problem with mental health care in America is not the same thing as them suggesting that the government ought to do something about it. Or that &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; ought to do something about it, necessarily. Republicans tend to place a LOT of faith in the free market and in private institutions. It&amp;#39;s likely that they think the solution to the mental health problem is for people to attend church more, get more involved in the community, or donate to private charities that provide mental health services. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect that there are two reasons why Republicans don&amp;#39;t back legislation that would address gun violence or mental health care:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) They don&amp;#39;t believe that there&amp;#39;s any possibility that a policy-based solution would help in any way, due to their mistrust of government and faith in free markets, and&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) While I rarely hear this spoken aloud, I think if they&amp;#39;re honest, they believe that having the freedom to own and carry guns is worth the lives lost to gun violence. If the cost of their ability to carry concealed and shoot their AR-15 on the weekends is that some strangers die every so often because a mentally unstable person legally purchases a gun, I think maybe they&amp;#39;re okay with that deep down. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc38xmt", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5mf34d/cmvmental_health_is_simply_a_red_herring_for_gun/dc38xmt/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483762541.0, "author_flair_text": "52\u2206", "created_utc": 1483733741.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mf34d", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mf34d", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc37raj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "thekraken8him", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc36znv", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I agree with you there, but honestly mental health care is a much broader problem and causes more problems than just mass shootings.
