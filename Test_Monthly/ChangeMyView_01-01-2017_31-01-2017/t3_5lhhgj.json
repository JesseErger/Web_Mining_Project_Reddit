All life exists as food for other life. That's why we exist in the first place and how natural selection works. Natural selection is an arms race of things \"trying\" to get better at avoiding being eaten by other things while getting better at being able to, themselves, eat other living things.\n\nAnimals kill other animals in the trillions per day. This isn't some tragedy; it's nature.\n\nThe reason humans don't kill other humans -- which we actually do very regularly, by the way -- is because of genetic social cohesion. That is, natural selection is driven by reproductive success -- genes that produce traits that help make more copies of themselves will inherently exist more commonly than genes that produce traits that aren't as good at making copies of themselves. That includes our physical and psychological traits.\n\nGiven limited resources, there is mathematical benefit in collaborating instead of competing. That is, if there is enough food for two people and there are three people, two ganging up on the one will get the food and split it. This principle is what makes the difference between social animals, like humans, and individualistic animals. Humans have often killed each other *between* groups, but within group loyalty means we evolved neutral truces instinctively with others. It's that instinct for neutrality with other humans we view as part of \"us\" and not \"them\" that leads us to principles like the golden rule.\n\nSince animals cannot reciprocate such rules, and we don't share genes for co-evolution, we generally don't have such neutral instincts with animals.\n\nPut another way, if we remove the rules against murder, we'd be putting ourselves at greater risk because now we have to be wary that somebody might murder us, and build protective groups around us. Neutral rules of not murdering make sense when they can be reciprocated. It's not about some general love for all life forms. Justice systems also improve upon this tendency.\n\nNon-human animals are quite different in that respect, so your analogy doesn't fit. We tend to agree not to harm animals *unnecessarily*, but that is not a universal value. It is generally a luxury we can hold because we now live in societies of abundance. A society of scarcity would have much different values, so you need to account for that in any moral evaluation.\n\nBut you also confuse *need* with *preference*. People very much like meat. Sure, we can survive without meat, but we evolved with a natural taste for it as we evolved eating it and many of us like it. It provides a great source of protein. Life isn't about just doing the minimal need to survive. People generally like to do things they enjoy. We don't *need* to play sports, or video games, but we play them anyway. Think of all of the environmental damage from everything that people simply enjoy doing, such as all the cars at sports games, the environmental costs of stadiums, power used, etc. If only we'd just lay in bed all day and be fed an intravenous synthetic food sufficient to stay alive, that'd be a much better way to live? No, life is about doing things you enjoy and like, and meat is part of that.\n\nOn top of that, we almost universally eat domesticate animals. That is, we eat animals that wouldn't exist if we didn't create them. The cattle we eat don't exist in nature and never did. They wouldn't survive in it either. They've been artificially bred for thousands of years for human purposes, including meat and dairy cattle. If we all stopped eating meat tomorrow, billions of cattle would die anyway. They would all cease to exist. Either we kill them or let them lose in which case they die soon after from predators, disease, or starvation. It would probably be an environmental disaster as well if it happened quickly.\n\nEither way, the entire collection of domesticated species that we eat would be wiped from the planet. They would no longer exist if we stopped eating them.\n\nAt your age, I suspect you've got in your head a single, simplistic idea (as we all do at that age), and we double-down on it like it's the only thought that exists. Yes, killing animals as a general principle sounds bad. But when you put it in context of what life is, what being human is, what we eat and where they come from, and what would happen if we stopped, then it doesn't make much sense to suggest that there is something wrong with eating animals.\n\nI also love plants. There are some really fascinating ones, really attractive ones, and trees are damn fund to climb and play on. That doesn't mean I don't eat fruits and vegetables, or make things out of wood. \n\n\"Sentience\" is not some magical state of freedom from death, or a reason not to eat something.

What value results from allowing sentient animals to survive and not a non-sentient plant? That's better for the animal, not for the plant, and I'm less happy. Now take into account that the *domesticated* sentient animal wouldn't exist at all if it weren't intended to be meat.

The initial question was why I don't eat humans and this is one of the major reasons.  In a different hypothetical world where this issue is not present, then there is one less thing stopping me from eating humans.  However, that is not the world we live in, so it has little bearing on the conversation.\n\n&gt;As you know, plants are on a lower tropic level than the animals we eat.

It is possible to have an efficient system that is unsustainable and an inefficient system that is sustainable.  Here I am not expressing a concern over efficiency, but sustainability.  So long as you are eating things that are on a lower trophic level, then there is still energy moving around the system and you can potentially maintain the set-up indefinitely.  However, as soon as you are eating your own species, then instead of having a constant flow of energy into that trophic level you have a loss of energy.  This cannot be maintained indefinitely and will eventually cause the system to collapse.  This is what I mean by it being unsustainable.\n\n&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong, but this seems to boil down to a \"might makes right\" argument in that we shouldn't eat other humans because they can protect themselves, but there is no problem with harming animals because they can't. Where does this leave children and the mentally disabled?\n\nDon't confuse a pragmatic decision with a moral one.  \"Might makes right\" may be a flawed argument from a moral standpoint, but from a pragmatic standpoint it is perfectly valid.  If I was trying to argue that eating humans was fundamentally immoral, then it would have no place here.  However, what I am arguing is the opposite and there are simply some pragmatic issues in the way of cannibalism being a worthwhile venture.  OP had initially made a comparison between eating animals and eating humans asking basically \"Why is one moral and the other immoral?\"  My answer is that neither is immoral and one simply has practical issues preventing it.\n\nChildren also fall under this because while they might not have all that much power by themselves, they represent an investment in the future by other people.  As such, all of the same issues occur.  Even the mentally disabled are usually in a situation where they are providing enough social support to people with more ability to make their will felt that they will be protected.  It is not worth entering a conflict with another group simply to get access to a food source that is rare and unsustainable to begin with.\n\n&gt;You're only saying this because you associate these animals with food in the first place. When a person or a pet dies, we don't eat them because it would be a waste otherwise.\n\nI associate everything with food unless there is a reason not to.  Out of caution, I might not eat something I am unsure about, but I still approach such an item as potential food until proven otherwise.  With eating human and pet dead, there are other issues besides the ones that I listed before to contend with.  Tissue of someone who has died of old age tends to border on indigestible and can often contain a higher concentration of chemicals that can prove toxic in the diet.  If it were up to me, these bodies would be used for research purposes as to not allow the body to go to waste.  I do consider it a shame that so many people are simply buried or cremated and I have no intention of such things being done with my body when I die.\n\n&gt;That's trivial though, sentience is not.\n\nWhat is trivial to one person might be vitally important to another.  Do you have a solid reason why your priorities are less trivial than mine?  From my end, I would argue that the ecosystem has been here long before any modern species existed and will likely be here after all modern species are long extinct.

Even if sentience was something very easy to define and identify and the only thing worth making a note of morally, this still leaves us not drawing the dividing line at plant/animal but somewhere within animal.  However, sentience is a bit more complicated than that.  Many plants have been shown to in one way or another be capable of perceiving and reacting to their surroundings.
