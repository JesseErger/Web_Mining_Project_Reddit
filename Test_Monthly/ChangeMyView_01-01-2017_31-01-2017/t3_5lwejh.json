There were some I agree with, many that I disagreed with, but one in particular caught my eye: he wanted to make it a criminal offence to burn the flag. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was made very clear to me while reading through that he was very focused on culture and unity. He wanted to make radio stations play a minimum 30% Canadian artists and a maximum of 50% American artists, and put up more Canadian flags. To just quickly comment on these two, the former I see as a completely useless infringement of the free market, radio stations should be able to play what they want, there&amp;#39;s still going to be stations playing mainly Canadian music and if people really care about that, those stations will flourish. The latter I don&amp;#39;t care much, I doubt it&amp;#39;ll cost that much in tax dollars as long as we don&amp;#39;t put them on every damn street corner, so why not flaunt our pretty flag? Feel welcome to comment on these points but know that it&amp;#39;s not the main point I&amp;#39;ll be making. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His argument for making burning the flag illegal, as he said, was that it is essentially an act of treason and undermines our cultural identity. It&amp;#39;s completely immoral to burn the flag and we can&amp;#39;t allow people to do so because all it does is damage and insult our culture, which makes us unique in the world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t agree with burning the flag. Canada is one of the best countries on earth, even when you compare it to the rest of the developed world. I know so few people who think this country is bad and if I saw anybody in person burning the flag I would think they&amp;#39;re a privileged idiot who doesn&amp;#39;t understand how great this place is and how lucky we are. And I&amp;#39;m a patriotic person, I always stand up and sing the national anthem at hockey games (eh?), I&amp;#39;ll always wear a Canadian flag pin on my backpack when going traveling, but this country isn&amp;#39;t what defines me. There&amp;#39;s a reason people here don&amp;#39;t complain much anymore about the lack of Canadian identity, because I think they, like me, realized that tolerance and individual freedom are much more important. I like the idea of a culture - it&amp;#39;s fun to learn about and partake in, but still, I am my own person and you are your own person and whether you are Canadian or American or black or white or male or female, while those factors can have an influence on your person, you are still your own unique person. You should never see yourself as an actor in a political society or a culture, you should see yourself as an individual with the right to do anything as long as it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt others (within reason, you shouldn&amp;#39;t be able to not wear a seatbelt or jaywalk imo)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that explains why I don&amp;#39;t care much about culture. I care about individual liberty over it. As such, people should be able to burn the flag as an act of expression as long as those flames don&amp;#39;t cause a fire and hurt anybody or the area around them. If we care about freedom of speech this should certainly be allowed, especially if we allow people to speak discriminatory things about people, as long as it doesn&amp;#39;t incite violence (which Canada does). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this isn&amp;#39;t something the government should have a moral stance on. The role of the government shouldn&amp;#39;t be to implement the values and beliefs of the people in power but just to provide a rule of law and an effective national defence to protect its citizens from foreign and domestic threats, and to provide a basic social safety net to help people who are less fortunate. I understand that there are values wound up in those  roles, but what they do is provide a basic responsibility of the government and that is to protect its citizens so people have the freedom and ability to choose their life path and do as they wish.    There&amp;#39;s a solid case for abortion being immoral. I don&amp;#39;t agree, but even if I did, I would likely still be in favour of it being legal because I understand that my morals are not law and I shouldn&amp;#39;t be telling others what to do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If one can&amp;#39;t make a solid argument for a certain policy benefiting the lives of individuals and protecting them, usually I can&amp;#39;t find myself agreeing with it. And criminalizing flag burning seems to just put a dent in our freedom of expression without adding any kind of benefit to our lives. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think I got everything.

At least morally and in their hearts, they are not truly a citizen.\n\nCriminalizing desecration of the flag is merely codifying the fact that a person who desecrates the flag is no longer meeting their moral obligations of citizenship.  It is important to note that desecration is not merely the act of destroying (which itself should probably be legal), but doing so explicitly out of contempt and malice towards the country.  \n\nI don't believe it is possible to reconcile that contempt and malice with a person meeting their moral obligations as citizens.
