You do neither yourself nor anyone else a favor by wild speculation - it's no different than when Birthers were convinced Jade Helm 15 was a plot by the Obama administration to impose martial law on the western states.\n\n&gt;The current demographic shift of the United States does not favor the conservatives or white supremacists in the US who back and serve in the Trump administration. The next four years presents them with possibly their last opportunity to maintain the status quo indefinitely and fulfill their agenda.\n\nThis isn't logically consistent with your later claims about Republican dominance in Congress.  If they're not worried about losing that \"in our lifetime\", then there is no urgency.  It's also not at all clear what kind of Presidency Trump will have or whether it'll be consistent over four years.  That's not to say he won't be a figurehead in some sense, but it's entirely possible and even probable that he'll refuse to be a figurehead even if establishment Republicans push him in that direction.\n\nMaking expansive predictions like this before he's even been inaugurated is dicey.\n\n&gt;The mainstream media has already failed to hold Trump\u2019s administration accountable and will not be willing to lose access to Trump because they can\u2019t have Trump headlines which bring in ratings.\n\nThat's just not true.  The media has been zealous (as they should be) in criticizing Trump, but they've also (generally) judiciously restrained themselves from Chicken Little hysterics and are waiting for him to actually do something with the power he'll be given.  Vetting his cabinet appointments is the job of Congress, and the media has covered that as much as they can.  Expect that coverage to increase as actual hearings pick up.\n\nThe reason they say \"Alt-Right\" instead of white supremacist is that they simply aren't the same thing and treating them that way is both wrong and counterproductive.  Moreover, this election should prove to us that simply calling something or someone racist in the media is not sufficient to rob it of credibility or turn the public against it.  The actual work you have to do is harder.\n\n&gt;The Executive branch has full authority to issue drone strikes on US Citizens, and has already done so on foreign soil. There is nothing stopping them from doing so on American soil outside of their willingness.\n\nWell, it's also still illegal to perform those strikes on US soil, also very hard to hide a Hellfire explosion in the middle of a America.  It's way easier and more productive to just arrest people.\n\n&gt;The Executive branch has the full authority to indefinitely detain US citizens at military prisons, and even send them to black sites overseas for interrogation, so long they pose a threat to national security or support enemies of the state\n\nBut that's highly unlikely (and dubiously accurate) for the simple fact that doing so would be politically dangerous for anyone that tried it on dissenters.\n\n&gt;The thinking among the establishment is that as the middle class continues to be destroyed if the pitchforks ever come out for the rich the gov\u2019t can use military force and detention to stop a civilian-lead revolution\n\nI don't know which establishment you're talking about, but as a veteran, I can tell you that any military forces deployed domestically against American citizens would be...highly unreliable.  There's a significant overlap between the military and Libertarian, fiscal conservative, social liberal, leave everyone the hell alone crowd; they aren't going to be keen on putting down riots.\n\n&gt;The Republican-controlled Senate and House are in the pockets of the oligarchy who are in full-support of Trump\u2019s administration because it is about deregulation, lower corporate taxes, and anti-Union.\n\nI will never forgive Princeton for taking the word \"oligarchy\" out behind the woodshed and beating it out of recognition.\n\n&gt;The Democrats are the Democrats, and let\u2019s be real\u2014 they don\u2019t have the teeth to mount an effective resistance for so many reasons.\n\nYou're failing to account for those Republicans that don't agree with Trump, Pence, or the amalgamated agenda put forth by the administration.  Politics isn't that simple; many Senators and Congressmen from both sides have points where they break with party orthodoxy.\n\n&gt;The GOP successfully gerrymandered all districts around the country, so the House will never be controlled by Democrats or even Moderates in our lifetimes. \n\nThat claim is more than a little absurd.  The House isn't going to change hands in the next 2-4 years, and it's a stretch to say 6-8, but history doesn't move on constant gradients.  Circumstances change, rules change, and parties lose power when they fail to accomplish the will of the people while in power.  To say that Republicans are probably going to keep the House for 50+ years is to ignore that history.\n\n&gt;The Democrats will not gain a majority in the Senate in 2018, not by a long shot.\n\nThey probably won't, but they might.  A lot can happen in two years - particularly if the Republican administration does unpopular things.  There's just no way to make solid predictions this far out when so many variables are still so...variable.\n\n&gt;A terrorist attack on American soil is almost certain in the next four years because nothing will serve the Trump administration better.\n\nIf you want to talk about partisanship that's destructive to the discourse, look no further.  I deeply dislike Trump, I think he'll make a terrible President, and I don't think he's a particularly good person.  *He's not fuckin Blofeld.*  He doesn't want a terrorist attack to expand his powers, and neither does anyone in his administration.  As bad as some of them may be, there's just no reason to believe that.  It takes effort to slander a shitty person, and it only hurts your case.

He will have to negotiate just like every president before him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you say republicans have taken over and nothing will ever get them out? How many people who vote Republican because they lean more Republican than they do Democrat? You will find the US is NOT split quite so evenly between Democrats and Republicans, it just always devolves into the two party system because of the voting systems. Once Republican parties start to antagonize their weakest supporters, you will start to see that the true diehard republicans are probably less than 25% of the country. No gerrymandering is going to make them win with only 25% of the votes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have the ability to impeach presidents and have used the power in the past. &lt;strong&gt;The people who voted for Trump, voted for what they hoped he would do, they did NOT vote for what you fear Trump will do.&lt;/strong&gt; Even his supporters might not follow him if he starts going off the path they thought he was going to follow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He is not going to be as bad as you fear, but at the end of the 4 years, you will probably still dislike all the things he has done. Just like the people who were scared Obama was going to ruin the country, and the people who thought Bush was going to ruin the country.... You&amp;#39;ll find things that you greatly dislike, but the US still stands after each president, and it is going to continue to stand after this one and the next one too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc8m2ay", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5n4he5/cmv_the_trump_administration_has_a_clear_path_to/dc8m2ay/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1484079730.0, "author_flair_text": "8\u2206", "created_utc": 1484050930.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 7, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5n4he5", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5n4he5", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc9evct", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SirLuciousLeftFoot", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc8pt8v", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "This video made some very valid points.\n\nEdit: Awarding \u2206.
