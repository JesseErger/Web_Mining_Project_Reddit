You can invent plenty of imaginary scenarios for which this would be especially offensive (dad was called a hobo his whole life and told his son to never become one, for example) but there is a consensus reason why being called a hobo is offensive.

It is not somehow completely divorced in every possible way from the context of gendered judgement of sexual proclivity.\n\nIt kind of is though. At least that's the way I've always seen it. It's understood to be insulting but in that context that's all it takes from the original meaning. Michael isn't calling Dwight promiscuous. That isn't the joke. He could just as easily be saying \"Dwight you ignorant cuck\" and it would mean the *exact same thing* (albeit less funny).\n\n&gt;&gt;That was the basis of the confusion.\n\n&gt;There was no confusion, just different interpretations and reactions.\n\nActually there was. That's why I made the post. I was genuinely confused as to what offense could be taken from the jokes in the OP.\n\n&gt;&gt;In this sort of situation, it's not really that the word is offensive so much as it is painful to hear. \n\n&gt;Distinction without a difference. What definition of \"offensive\" are you using exactly? Here's one: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/offensive\n\nOffensive is different because there's an understanding that the person making the comment is either attempting to harm or is too careless/ignorant to understand that it would cause harm. This is different from the \"boo thang\" scenario, as the person on the receiving end feels pain without blaming the speaker for their malice/ignorance.\n\n&gt;&gt;That's extremely vague and doesn't answer the question. \n\n&gt;I was being mostly sarcastic. However this is the second time you've said \"answer the question\" as though there is a single, universal reason by which **all** people would be offended by this one, specific joke. I thought we had established, and that you had said you understand, that that isn't how any of this works?\n\nI feel like you're being intentionally obtuse at this point. Obviously not everyone is going to feel exactly the same way and have the same reasoning, but there definitely *is* a consensus reasoning behind the offense. As I explained above and elsewhere in this thread, even without any special circumstances or scenarios, there should be a basis for someone feeling offended about something (and usually is).\n\n&gt;&gt; There are plenty of things that people take offense to that I understand, and plenty of things people take offense to that I don't understand. \n\n&gt;Do you always have to have a crystal clear understanding of the exact and minute motivations of people's preferences?\n\nPut a little less drastically, yes. I like knowing how other people feel and why they feel the way they do. It helps me empathize with them, make better decisions, and be a better human being. If you think this is a bad thing, feel free to tell me why.\n\n&gt;&gt;If a hypothetical Asian man was walking down the street and was bumped by a white guy, and the white guy turns and says \"watch where you're going, chink\", we wouldn't need to imagine scenarios for why this would be offensive. If someone asked you why it was, I'd assume you would have a reasonable and concise explanation for them. You wouldn't start listing a bunch of explanations and backstories and end it with a \"at the end of the day, who really knows why?\" because you would understand why such a gesture was offensive on its own. \n\n&gt;Yes, in easy to understand, obvious circumstances where everyone's motivations are perfectly and absolutely clear, and there is an obvious \"bad actor\" and an obvious \"victim\" it's easy to understand why people would fell the way they do.\n\nWhich is essentially what this situation is. I can create a more \"perfectly and absolutely clear hypothetical\" of this situation if you don't understand the basis behind the discussion, but yeah this was pretty straightforward for at least one person because they provided me some pretty great insight on the topic.\n\n&gt;In other situations where none of that is true it's can be less easy to understand the motivations of others, but certainly not impossible especially if you put in the slightest bit of effort.\n\nAnd now I'm under the impression that you didn't click the link and read the above discussion, because that's literally exactly what I did.\n\n&gt;In your mind is it beyond all reason and comprehension that a person might want to discourage the use of words and phrases used to amlign and harm others, even when those words and phrases are used in a joking manner? Let's be super duper clear here: I'm not asking if you agree with such a persons methods, goals, or perspective. I'm asking if you can try to understand where that person is coming from?\n\nThat's a very vague question that doesn't really apply here. You're basically saying \"can you accept that some people don't like certain harmful words?\" which isn't really relevant to the root of the question.\n\n&gt;&gt;This is exactly the same scenario, except I'm asking about something a little less straightforward, \n\n&gt;So **NOT** the exact same scenario, but actually a completely different scenario that bares absolutely no resemblance what so ever?\n\nIt's exactly the same thing with a minor change. It's like the difference between 2+5 and 110+135. Different question solved the exact same way, one's just a little more complicated. The fact that you don't understand that means you misunderstand the post.\n\n&gt;&gt;and something you don't understand. \n\n&gt;I understand it just fine and have laid out a few scenarios that are perfectly applicable. You've chosen to hand wave them off without consideration, \n\n\"without consideration\"?

It&amp;#39;s not as though within the joke the meaning of &amp;quot;slut&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;whore&amp;quot; are completely changed to something diametrically opposed to their original meaning. They are still gendered pejoratives &lt;strong&gt;being used as&lt;/strong&gt; gendered pejoratives. The joke is still playing off of the original meaning. It is not somehow completely divorced in every possible way from the context of gendered judgement of sexual proclivity.

The way I interpret people proclaiming that something offends them is them expressing their wish that I not do or say that offensive thing anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s extremely vague and doesn&amp;#39;t answer the question. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was being mostly sarcastic.
