Logic is abstract. And of course, if your definition of proof includes mathematical abstractions you can 'prove' anything including infinities, and the word proof itself becomes meaningless. You can prove infinity with math, but can you ever measure infinity? No...because you can never arrive at infinity in the real world. Hence the phrase 'you can't prove a negative' doesn't really have anything to do with math. In that sense, the phrase \"mathematical proof\" is a sort of oxymoron. Of course the mathematician will not like and probably will not agree with any of this, but there it is.

It relies on the axiom of:\n\n&gt;The only things that exist are those which are measurable with physical experiments.\n\nThis is where the concept of 'you can't prove a negative' originates. It depends on the scale and specificity of the claim being made. \n\nFirst the specificity. I claim that there is a chair in my room. I can measure the chair and prove its existence beyond a reasonable doubt. Now I claim that my chair is the only chair in my room. To do this I would have to prove a negative (that no other chairs exist in the room). This is impossible, because perhaps there is a chair there but it is being obfuscated somehow, or maybe it is existing in another dimension. To eliminate these possibilities within my claim and strengthen the truth of it, I must be specific and say \"according to all known laws of physics, there only exists one chair in my room in this dimension of space where I am existing.\" Or something like that. The same is true of proving a positive. I claim that a chair exists in my room. I measure the chair with as much precision as I can, but there still is a possibility that despite my best efforts, the properties I measure are an illusion and there is no chair. Thus my claim must be more specific there as as well..\"a chair exists in my room that conforms to all the currently known properties of a physical chair that can be measured with my tools in this universe\". The scientists usually don't concern themselves with unknown or unknowable properties or properties that cannot be measured. Nor do they always explicitly attach all those specific conditions to their statements...such things should be implicit in any scientific claim.\n\nSecond, the scale. The larger the scale and unreachability of experiment, the less proof there can be for either a positive or a negative. I have a small cube of volume in space, arbitrarily small. Small enough that I may create a measuring device that can detect all the molecules within the cube. Say there lived within that cube microscopic organisms that could only survive if, within the cube, there were 90% oxygen molecules. Ok, so without doing any measurements I simply observe that the organisms are alive, therefore I formulate a hypothesis that within that small volume of space there must be 90% oxygen molecules. If it were not, the organisms would be dead. Still we have no proof, just logical deduction. To prove the hypothesis we must build our experiment and measure all the molecules (at least 90% of them) within that small cubic volume of space. Thus our hypothesis is either 'proven' or not. Now, when you scale that proposition up to say, the Earth's atmosphere, things become more complicated. You can do the same thing...logically deduce that because we are alive and breathing that there must then be 90% oxygen in the atmosphere. But no experiment can be devised to measure every molecule in the atmosphere and prove this hypothesis empirically. The same applies to the inverse, like proving the atmosphere is not 90% chlorine gas. At such abstract or large scales, there really is no such thing as 'proof' (as in empirically measurable or testable claims either for or against a proposition).", "edited": 1483981934.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem here lies in the definition of &amp;#39;proof&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mathematician will say that proof lies within abstract mathematical concepts. This relies on the following axiom: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To simplify to the point of glossing over what &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot; even means, for a second, we generally accept that, for all practical purposes, classical logic describes the behaviour of truth in the real world, so we can logically prove infinitely many negatives about the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Math is the logic of quantity. Logic is abstract. And of course, if your definition of proof includes mathematical abstractions you can &amp;#39;prove&amp;#39; anything including infinities, and the word proof itself becomes meaningless. You can prove infinity with math, but can you ever measure infinity? No...because you can never arrive at infinity in the real world. Hence the phrase &amp;#39;you can&amp;#39;t prove a negative&amp;#39; doesn&amp;#39;t really have anything to do with math. In that sense, the phrase &amp;quot;mathematical proof&amp;quot; is a sort of oxymoron. Of course the mathematician will not like and probably will not agree with any of this, but there it is. You can prove almost anything &lt;strong&gt;mathematically&lt;/strong&gt;, but to prove something &lt;strong&gt;practically&lt;/strong&gt; is a different matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hard scientist will say that proof is something that can be experimentally or empirically observed.
