Right now we have an opt-out system of firearms ownership, everyone is eligible to by a gun when they reach a certain age (in my state it&amp;#39;s 18 for long guns, 21 for handguns) unless they are disqualified by being convicted of a felony, being involuntarily held in a mental hospital, being dishonorably discharged from the military, or having a domestic violence conviction and a host of other smaller reasons that make someone a prohibited person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We should make it an opt-in system, where no one is eligible to buy a gun unless they go through a rigorous process to demonstrate to the best of their ability that they are not dangerous to others, and that they are responsible enough to be in possession of firearms. This process could include a much more thorough background check process, multiple interviews, perhaps some of them with law enforcement officials or with mental health officials to evaluate the reason why they want a gun and determine to the best of their ability whether or not the applicant should be trusted with a firearm. Mandatory training on the safety of using firearms, including safe storage and education on appropriate use of force, and preferably mandatory follow up training every year or so. There could be other restrictions on owning firearms, but these are just a few examples that I am able to think of on the spot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changing the second amendment to reflect the modern purpose of firearms ownership, which I believe to be allowing law abiding citizens to protect themselves from criminals, rather than allowing citizens to own firearms to form militias to overthrow a tyrranical government. I believe that the 2nd amendment is archaic and outdated in its meaning, and needs to be adapted to reflect the modern political climate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limiting the power of the NRA, primarily by preventing firearms manufacturers and firearms accessory manufacturers from donating huge amounts of money to them, effectively making the NRA the most powerful lobbying group in the United States (correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong on this one). A study published in 2013 called &amp;quot;NRA: Blood money&amp;quot; analyzed exactly where the NRA&amp;#39;s money came from, and a large portion of it came from the manufacturers of firearms accessories, such as people who make holsters for handguns. No handgun ownership= no one buying holsters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I believe that honest gun control will allow us to reach a compromise between the far right, NRA extreme of &amp;quot;everyone gets any type of gun they want&amp;quot; and the far left anti-gun extreme of &amp;quot;no one should have guns except for the police and the military&amp;quot;. I believe that with a strengthened background check process, law abiding citizens should be able to own and carry firearms for self defense. I believe that there is a difference between an offensive firearm, and a defensive firearm, as well as a &amp;quot;sporting firearm&amp;quot;  related to the ground rules that I set up in the beginning of this post. Defensive and sporting firearms should be allowed after someone passes a rigorous background check process, offensive firearms need to go away forever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brief example of what I determine to be defensive firearms: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Semi automatic handguns with a magazine capacity of about 15 rounds or so. I believe that 15 rounds in a handgun is a reasonable amount of firepower for self protection in a home, where the home owner may be waking up in the middle of the night and grabbing their gun without the ability to carry extra magazines. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pump action or semi-automatic tube fed shotguns with a magazine capacity no larger than 7 shots. that&amp;#39;s 7 rounds in the tube, plus one in the gun for a total of 8 rounds. That is more than enough for home protection, and reloading a tube fed shotgun one round at a time limits the reload speed to a defensive level. It would be rather difficult for someone to reload this type of firearm fast enough to incur massive casualties. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any type of revolver &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sporting firearms&amp;quot;: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Manually operated rifles, such as bolt action rifles and lever action rifles. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Double barrel, pump, and semi-auto shotguns holding no more than 8 rounds in the tube (2 rounds for a double barrel shotgun of course) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Semi-automatic .22lr caliber firearms with a magazine capacity of no more than 10 rounds. Many people use firearms like the Ruger 10/22 as a sporting weapon, I feel that the small caliber of this firearm and others like it limits it to a sporting purpose. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Offensive firearms: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Semi-automatic handgun magazines with the capacity to hold more than 15 rounds. 15 rounds is an arbitrary limit, but there are magazines for semi-automatic pistols that hold up to 33 rounds (for a glock 9mm) and others that hold similar amounts of ammo, and these have been used in mass shootings such as in the gabriel giffords shooting, jared loughner used a Glock 19 with a 33 round magazine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Semi-automatic centerfire rifles such as AR15&amp;#39;s, Mini 14&amp;#39;s, Tavors, SCARs, the Sig MCX, Hi point carbines, and a host of other rifles that meet the same criteria. I say all semi-auto centerfire rifles because these types of firearms basically cannot be regulated in a way that effectively limits their firepower to a safe level. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Semi-automatic or pump action shotguns that hold more than 8 rounds (including a round in the chamber) or that feed from a detachable magazine, such as a Saiga 12 GA. Other &amp;quot;Hi capacity shotguns&amp;quot; like the Kel tec KSG, SRM 1216, and DP-12 would fall under this category as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By enacting these gun control changes, I believe that we can reduce casualties from mass shootings and potentially prevent mass shootings altogether. Of course people will always find ways to hurt each other, we cannot ever 100% control someones behavior, but we can take away or limit the tools that they would use to exercise that bad behavior. I believe that allowing sporting and defensive firearms ownership would be a fair compromise that would allow law abiding citizens to protect themselves. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If criminals adapt to these new gun control laws, then we should adapt in turn. if we need to lower the magazine capacity of handguns to 10 rounds, then so be it. If we need to lower the capacity of shotguns to 5 rounds, then so be it. Right now, the regulations that I outlined would eliminate firearms capable of the most amount of firepower &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OTHER MISCELLANEOUS LAWS AND RESTRICTIONS: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Universal background checks. No gun show loophole, no cash and carry used gun purchases. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regulation of magazine and ammo ownership. If someone is accumulating huge amounts of magazines and ammo, that is something that law enforcement needs to know about. Ammo and magazine purchase permits that require a background check to obtain would prevent prohibited persons from obtaining magazines and ammo. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regulation or elimination of 80% lowers and frames that allow prohibited people to obtain firearms &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regulation of every other functional part of a firearm such as the upper receiver of an AR15 or slide and barrel of a handgun. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mandatory registration for every firearm purchase. This would reduce the likelihood of illegal gun sales and cash and carry purchases if the buyer knew that the gun they would be selling would be able to be traced back to them.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s basically it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR We can allow law abiding citizens to own firearms that are appropriate for self defense and sporting purposes while enacting reasonable gun control legislation that would limit casualties of mass shootings and possibly prevent some mass shootings from happening.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: It&amp;#39;s been 5 hours.

Nor has any 65-year-old grandmother like me. \n\n&gt;I feel that the defensive and sporting firearms that I outlined in my OP would not punish law abiding gun owners.\n\n I'm already being punished in California. For example we *de facto* cannot buy .22 snake shot (which has an effective range of about 15 feet and isn't available in our state, yet is critical for protecting orchards, aviaries, new plantings from starlings, rattlesnakes, squirrels and other vermin.) We can't buy various types of high velocity ammunition suitable for downing large predators at a distance (I was mauled by a bear; I can assure you I don't care to get close enough to another to try to run it off with a shotgun.) \n\nNor can we now possess a magazine that holds more than ten shots. (Have you ever tried to run off a pack of coyotes intent on bringing down a newborn foal on a far pasture in the middle of the night? I don't know about you, but I'm simply not that good a shot-- especially when it's hard to see a quarter mile away on a moonless night and gee, I didn't know there'd be a dozen of them out there when I ran out in my pajamas). \n\nConsider also that all the guns used in mass shootings since Columbine have been *legally purchased and registered*. Think about that for a minute.  What possible difference would onerous gun laws have made? Unless you're prepared to confiscate all long guns and handguns, those with mal-intent will be able to obtain them (or 3D print them).  Moreover, the firearms most often used in mass incidents are handguns, not ranch rifles or shotguns (which let's face it, are *very* hard to conceal carry and maneuver in interior quarters). \n\nLimiting the legitimate use and *choice* of rural property-owners'  firearms (which are just as critical to our work as our equally murderous chainsaws and hay rakes /s), only fosters disrespect for --and open flouting of-- the law, and in my experience is *directly* responsible for my neighbors having elected cognitively incompetent despots to high federal office. \n\nMore to the point, who's going to stop them or confiscate their firearms?  Not local sheriffs. Not you and your suburban brethren.  Certainly not the Sacramento politicians who passed these short-sighted and discriminatory regulations. So what's the purpose of passing them? \n\nDo not underestimate the depth of contempt for anti-gun regulations held by most rural Americans. Law-abiding gun enthusiasts may be the stalwarts of the law-and-order brigade, but as recent elections have shown us, the blowback may be more than we've bargained for --or are prepared to respond to. \n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;May I ask &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, you may not, because I&amp;#39;ve no desire to implicate or incriminate myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just because we haven&amp;#39;t heard of it doesn&amp;#39;t mean it hasn&amp;#39;t happened, and doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it won&amp;#39;t happen. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, in the last fifty years, and in spite of hundreds of mass shootings by suburban white kids, no rancher has ever been involved or arrested.

Moreover, the firearms most often used in mass incidents are handguns, not ranch rifles or shotguns (which let&amp;#39;s face it, are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; hard to conceal carry and maneuver in interior quarters). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Limiting the legitimate use and &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; of rural property-owners&amp;#39;  firearms (which are just as critical to our work as our equally murderous chainsaws and hay rakes /s), only fosters disrespect for --and open flouting of-- the law, and in my experience is &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; responsible for my neighbors having elected cognitively incompetent despots to high federal office. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More to the point, who&amp;#39;s going to stop them or confiscate their firearms?  Not local sheriffs. Not you and your suburban brethren.  Certainly not the Sacramento politicians who passed these short-sighted and discriminatory regulations. So what&amp;#39;s the purpose of passing them? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do not underestimate the depth of contempt for anti-gun regulations held by most rural Americans. Law-abiding gun enthusiasts may be the stalwarts of the law-and-order brigade, but as recent elections have shown us, the blowback may be more than we&amp;#39;ve bargained for --or are prepared to respond to. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbxmndd", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lp6nj/cmv_i_think_that_reasonable_gun_control_can_all/dbxmndd/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483449838.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483421038.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbxj9w4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "antigunnut57", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dbxivjk", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt;protect and euthanize our livestock, hunt our food, control pests and predators alone in the nighttime-\n\nYou can do all of these things with the defensive and sporting firearms that I outlined in my post \n\nMay I ask exactly what type of weapons you feel you need to adequately protect yourself in the environment you live in? \n\n&gt;when was the last time you heard of a farmer or rancher's kid going berserk and shooting up a classroom or a shopping mall?

Your response is assuming arguments I never made.\n\nMy point was that a handful of people die from murders involving one type of gun which you want to ban outright while thousands are killed by a gun left relatively intact in your plan.\n\n&gt;&gt;I wouldn't take issue with your plan if it involved limiting capacity on handguns as well as rifles-but to ban military style sporting rifles while having Glock 19's on the street with a 15 round limit will accomplish next to nothing in combatting crime.\n\n&gt;My plan also does involve placing restrictions on the magazine capacity of handguns by limiting the magazine capacity to 15 rounds. As far as having Glock 19's on the street with 15 round magazines, the strengthened background check process that I proposed would also reduce the number of guns \"on the street\". All of those guns involved in the majority of gun crimes started out at a gun store. By raising the restrictions on who can buy firearms, you effectively are limiting the supply of new guns that will end up \"on the street\". The current supply will eventually dry up if it is not being replaced. \n\nSo if you're confident that enhanced background checks will affect the statistical majority lf crimes, why not apply them to the guns used in the statistical minoriy? Why go for an outright ban of one weapon type while allowing the deadlier type a more lenient approach? \n\n\n&gt;Mass shootings are a lot easier to fix. We should at least do everything we can to prevent mass shootings, not only because of the total percentage of people killed, but because of the nature of mass shootings, being that they are heinous and extremely preventable. \n\nActually, being a statistical outlier makes makes a mass shooting much harder to predict. With handguns we see patterns like repeat criminals, crimes of passion, self defense, etc. \n\nThat's why legislation makes sense in those areas and why handgun regulation has become such a big deal in major cities.\n\n\n&gt;12 people killed in Aurora colorado and close to 60 injured may not be statistically significant in the broad picture, but it is still significant. If we could have prevented that from happening, we should have. \n\nBanning AR's wouldn't have prevented Aurora.\n\nGo to the list of the worst mass shootings in US history-again, predominately handguns. Virginia Tech involved a Walther .22 and a Glock 9mm.\n\nYour post argument revolves around the claim that AR's require special legislation but semi auto sporting rifles have been around for nearly a hundred years and yet still handguns are the go to murder weapon.\n\n\n\n&gt;It's like saying that drunk driving deaths only account for a small percentage of overall motor vehicle deaths, so we should just completely ignore the drunk driving deaths and not even try to stop them because motor vehicle accidents will continue to happen anyways. (btw, I'm not sure what the total percentage of drunk driving deaths are compared to the overall rate of motor vehicle accidents, I'm just using this as an example) \n\nSo to take your drunk driving example. Mass murders are a subset of gun violence. To best compare your analogy, we'd be banning Jagerbombs because those deaths made the news while Coors light kills far more and is sold at every gas station.\n\nI'm not disagreeing with your overall mindset. I agree that we need a constructive conversation about gun control, but going after weapons based on them being more deadly in theory rather than being statistically more deadly is just creating more opposition and conflict with hobbyists and enthusiasts which make up the vast majority lf AR owners. You're banning some farmer's thousand dollar varmint rifle while Hi Points are still being sold for 150 bucks with 15 round mags.\n\nAgain, I'm not arguing for or against gun control.

Your response is assuming arguments I never made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My point was that a handful of people die from murders involving one type of gun which you want to ban outright while thousands are killed by a gun left relatively intact in your plan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t take issue with your plan if it involved limiting capacity on handguns as well as rifles-but to ban military style sporting rifles while having Glock 19&amp;#39;s on the street with a 15 round limit will accomplish next to nothing in combatting crime.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My plan also does involve placing restrictions on the magazine capacity of handguns by limiting the magazine capacity to 15 rounds. As far as having Glock 19&amp;#39;s on the street with 15 round magazines, the strengthened background check process that I proposed would also reduce the number of guns &amp;quot;on the street&amp;quot;. All of those guns involved in the majority of gun crimes started out at a gun store. By raising the restrictions on who can buy firearms, you effectively are limiting the supply of new guns that will end up &amp;quot;on the street&amp;quot;. The current supply will eventually dry up if it is not being replaced. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re confident that enhanced background checks will affect the statistical majority lf crimes, why not apply them to the guns used in the statistical minoriy? Why go for an outright ban of one weapon type while allowing the deadlier type a more lenient approach? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mass shootings are a lot easier to fix. We should at least do everything we can to prevent mass shootings, not only because of the total percentage of people killed, but because of the nature of mass shootings, being that they are heinous and extremely preventable. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually, being a statistical outlier makes makes a mass shooting much harder to predict. With handguns we see patterns like repeat criminals, crimes of passion, self defense, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why legislation makes sense in those areas and why handgun regulation has become such a big deal in major cities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;12 people killed in Aurora colorado and close to 60 injured may not be statistically significant in the broad picture, but it is still significant. If we could have prevented that from happening, we should have. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Banning AR&amp;#39;s wouldn&amp;#39;t have prevented Aurora.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go to the list of the worst mass shootings in US history-again, predominately handguns. Virginia Tech involved a Walther .22 and a Glock 9mm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your post argument revolves around the claim that AR&amp;#39;s require special legislation but semi auto sporting rifles have been around for nearly a hundred years and yet still handguns are the go to murder weapon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like saying that drunk driving deaths only account for a small percentage of overall motor vehicle deaths, so we should just completely ignore the drunk driving deaths and not even try to stop them because motor vehicle accidents will continue to happen anyways. (btw, I&amp;#39;m not sure what the total percentage of drunk driving deaths are compared to the overall rate of motor vehicle accidents, I&amp;#39;m just using this as an example) &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to take your drunk driving example. Mass murders are a subset of gun violence. To best compare your analogy, we&amp;#39;d be banning Jagerbombs because those deaths made the news while Coors light kills far more and is sold at every gas station.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not disagreeing with your overall mindset. I agree that we need a constructive conversation about gun control, but going after weapons based on them being more deadly in theory rather than being statistically more deadly is just creating more opposition and conflict with hobbyists and enthusiasts which make up the vast majority lf AR owners. You&amp;#39;re banning some farmer&amp;#39;s thousand dollar varmint rifle while Hi Points are still being sold for 150 bucks with 15 round mags.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I&amp;#39;m not arguing for or against gun control. I&amp;#39;m saying that an AR-15 isn&amp;#39;t as much of a leap over a handgun as you paint it to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit-All my ofs are ifs, I&amp;#39;m sloppy at working a phone tonight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbxkji9", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lp6nj/cmv_i_think_that_reasonable_gun_control_can_all/dbxkji9/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483446551.0, "author_flair_text": "12\u2206", "created_utc": 1483417751.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 6, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lp6nj", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lp6nj", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 6, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lp6nj", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lp6nj", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 7, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lp6nj", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lp6nj", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lp6nj", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbyaxu0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sheexthro", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dbxprdy", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt;I was making a comparison to the overall firepower of those weapons, and demonstrating the handguns are capable of less offensive firepower than semi-automatic rifles.\n\nThis is why your reasoning - and your proposed laws - are fundamentally misguided. \"Offensive firepower\" has nothing to do with it.

You can just reduce the casualties by limiting the amount of firepower someone is able to obtain. All of the other methods you just talked about are things people will do when they CAN\u2019T legally buy firearms. These are methods we will have to make criminals resort to when they can\u2019t just buy anything they want legally. so what, we should just continue to allow mass shooters to buy their guns legally because if they can\u2019t they\u2019ll have to do something different that is much more difficult and less effective? That\u2019s the proposed outcome of my post. I never said that you can 100% stop violence or control people\u2019s behaviors. But you can make it much more difficult from them, and ultimately reduce casualties. \n\nto use your example of the drug war, no we cannot ever 100% stop people from manufacturing or using drugs. But instead of just letting people buy all of the meth making material they want, and openly selling it in a legal meth store, we drive those people underground, force them to use extremely crude and dangerous methods, and we have an active police force that regularly scoops them up. \n\n&gt;It's doomed to failure and unworkable and exactly the wrong approach.\n\nMay I ask you what you think the right approach is to deal with mass shootings? I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re going to say something about gun free zones and concealed carry permits. \n\n&gt;You are worried about mass shootings, and are ignoring drug war bloodshed.\n\ndrug war bloodshed? I believe this is the first time you\u2019ve brought this up. You\u2019re talking about criminals killing each other over drugs, when I\u2019m talking about madmen legally buying firearms and using them to kill large numbers of people for personal reasons. \n\n&gt;Until you can convince Americans to stop snorting, smoking or shooting up high profit narcotics blood will be spilled. \n\n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONTINUED: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or Orlando:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;The shooter bought his guns at a gun store, where he was background checked.\nHe had a concealed carry permit, for which he was background checked.\nHe had a state firearms license, for which he was background checked.\nHe was also an armed security guard for a government contractor which required an active security clearance, for which he was (you guessed it) background checked.\nSomewhere in the last two he had to have 60 hours of training and a medical exam that certified he had no issues.\nThe FBI interviewed him, twice, and investigated him for 10 months.

Nothing fancier than a drill press needed &amp; mill table.\n\n&gt; [Mexico &amp; Phillipines are weak! argument]\n\nOh ok, so how draconian are you wanting to go?  Because our \"strong\" government hasn't been able to make progress in stamping out homicides in inner cities for decades.  Afghanistan is a 3rd world country, but that's not an argument that this wouldn't happen - if anything, the amount of education &amp; technology here would ensure that firearms would still get made, in quantity.  All it takes is a machine shop owner who wants $$$ and you've got dozens, if not hundreds (or thousands) of guns out there.\n\n&gt; Maybe to make certain types of firearms, but the same types of firearms we can buy legally at a gun store? I don\u2019t think so.\n\n\"Oh piddle, I want to kill this fellow, but I can't possibly be bothered to do so with such a crude looking weapon.  I say, you rapscallion who is on my 'turf' without permission! Away with you, lest I retrieve my bespoke AK.\"\n\nAre you for real?  Cosmetics only matter for store bought weapons going to legal purchasers who care about such things.  People looking for something to blast others with won't give a crap.  You are ignoring decades of junkies being all too happy to grind up powder, set fire to rocks in glass pipes, or make bongs out of trash to get high, you think murderers aren't going to be inventive?\n\n&gt;  Prohibition in the US didn\u2019t work because again, we completely banned something, not regulated it. I\u2019m not talking about completely banning ALL firearms, I\u2019m talking about enforcing stricter and more meaningful regulations.\n\nYes we get it, you don't want to ban all guns, you want to ban many of them, and you don't want to listen to any criticism of your \"meaningful\" restrictions, much less educate yourself on the subject before proposing them.  You are handwaving away any objections with 'Well it could work *here*' or 'it's *harder*' while ignoring that your restrictions aren't going to be any more effective than existing laws.\n\nHow strict do you want to go?  What are you going to do when that doesn't work either?  See Breivik.  See Orlando.\n\n&gt; Yeah, of course there will always be some weird obscure firearms around. Of course the shelf life of a firearm is extremely long, almost unlimited. but again, you\u2019re forgetting that we have an active police force, that actively takes guns off the streets. \n\nUntil that gun is actually confiscated, it's not off the streets.  You clearly aren't aware of things like \"[community guns](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/11/nyregion/hidden-communal-guns-are-more-common.html)\" or the fact that replacement will happen.\n\n&gt; Most gun owners own a large amount of firearms. That doesn\u2019t mean that there are 350 million people with guns. I\u2019m also more worried about people who are buying new firearms than I am worried about everyone who already owns guns.\n\nYou have no idea how many firearms the average owner has.  The lowest estimate is that 33% of households have guns, with more realistic estimates being well over 40% and I'd say that's low even then. \n\nYou shouldn't worry about any of them, you clearly have some paranoia issues.\n\n&gt; You\u2019re forgetting that most criminals caught with guns don\u2019t even have a full magazine of ammo,\n\n[Citation needed]\n\n&gt; and are sometimes caught with the wrong caliber in the gun. \n\nIrrelevant. Dumb criminals are dumb, film at 11.  On top of this, you don't get it both ways: if criminals are so dumb they can't even buy the right ammo, therefore we don't need more gun control.\n\n&gt; Our street criminals who cannot buy guns legally are not well equipped. \n\nHow well equipped do they need to be to kill rivals?  This isn't westworld with custom fitted, bespoke weapons.  A crudely finished Makarov or 1911 will be just fine.  These are people who have adapted tactics brilliantly to avoid having cops or rival dealers get their money and drugs, you seriously think they can't figure out how to obtain weapons?  Where exactly do you think coke, heroin, x and other imported drugs come from?\n\n&gt; And you\u2019re also forgetting that our mass shooters are not using old sten guns and STG. 44\u2019s because they are just going to a gun store and buying newly manufactured guns legally.\n\nYet Orlando and San Bernardino show that they are more than willing to jump through every hoop and don't care.\n\n&gt;  As far as specifically where people in mexico are getting RPG\u2019s, machine guns, and grenade launchers? these are not the type of weapons that prohibited persons in the United States are able to get.v\n\nMexico has **far stricter gun control laws than the US**.   Look at this picture of guns seized in Mexico: http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/international/mexico%20guns%20banner5.jpg\n\nSee those two gold things? 40mm HEDP M203 grenade launcher rounds. Totally not legal to purchase in the US. To the left of the image, you can see an RPG variant. Also not coming from the US. These people have no problems trafficking drugs all over the world, sourcing guns isn't an issue for them. They are buying them from corrupt cops, and military units including FARC. Remember, the Zeta's started out as Mexican Special Forces guys who went rogue.\n\nYou cut off legal guns here, and you better believe that machineguns and the like are going to show up.  After all, if it's already illegal and you are going to jail, why not?  Remember, it's the first murder that's expensive, every one after that is free.\n\n&gt; in Afghanistan and Iraq they have full auto AK\u2019s, PKM\u2019s, and rpg\u2019s because they basically don\u2019t have a standing government, and of course they are openly trading with Pakistan who is actively equipping ISIS, those types of guns were mass produced by Russia and sold all over the world. We don\u2019t see a lot of those types of weapons at all in the United states because we have a very strong, standing government. Civilians here are not going to be able to get there hands on RPG\u2019S and belt fed machine guns and grenade launchers. If they could, they already would.\n\nWhich is why heroin, cocaine, meth, extacy, and human beings aren't traded on the black market here. At all. Ever.  Because people can get pills and just go on Tinder.  Right?  You don't seem to understand supply and demand, and when shown that restrictions have no effect &amp; result in substitution you handwave it away.   Heavier weapons show up in war zones because there's a demand for them.  You turn the US into a warzone, guess what?\n\n&gt; Metal working, injection molding and chemistry require tools, equipment, and skills to use that the average person doesn\u2019t have. \n\nDude, c'mon.  [MAC-10s are essentially sheet metal](http://www.theflatspot.net/mac10---45-lower-receiver-flat.html) and any machine shop can crank these out.  You seriously think this is going to be more difficult than an industrial grow op for weed? Making lab grade meth?  The injection molding is for modern era designs like glocks - people blasted each other for decades with 1911s and BARs.  And again, a Sten is just metal tube. \n\nIt being \"easy\" to go to a gun store is why homebrew stuff isn't showing up.  When it's difficult, demand will create incentive for supply to be replenished via other sources.\n\n&gt; It is more difficult than snorting blow, but do you think that if every coke head out there had the skills and know how to manufacture their own coke, wouldn\u2019t they be doing it?\n\nOh so now your recognize that despite the difficulty, the illegal product is still available?  Glad to help.\n\n&gt; All of those laws WERE flimsy. It\u2019s not the number of laws, it\u2019s the substance of the laws.\n\nSo you admit that the laws are security theater and didn't accomplish their stated goal for stopping crime.\n\n&gt; [Orlando]Again, you cannot ever completely control someone\u2019s behavior. These laws would have weeded out a large number of people. \n\nBut you started this thread specifically about \"mass shootings\" - this guy specifically abided by every single law you could want, many of them not \"flimsy\" and still committed the worst mass shooting in US history.\n\nYeah, large number of people would have been weeded out, the vast majority of them **never would have committed any crimes to begin with**.  Worry less about them, and the fact that your laws didn't stop the guy who **murdered dozens.**\n\n&gt;  The Orlando shooter slipped through the cracks.\n\nHe didn't \"slip through the cracks.

Remember, it&amp;#39;s the first murder that&amp;#39;s expensive, every one after that is free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;in Afghanistan and Iraq they have full auto AK\u2019s, PKM\u2019s, and rpg\u2019s because they basically don\u2019t have a standing government, and of course they are openly trading with Pakistan who is actively equipping ISIS, those types of guns were mass produced by Russia and sold all over the world. We don\u2019t see a lot of those types of weapons at all in the United states because we have a very strong, standing government. Civilians here are not going to be able to get there hands on RPG\u2019S and belt fed machine guns and grenade launchers. If they could, they already would.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is why heroin, cocaine, meth, extacy, and human beings aren&amp;#39;t traded on the black market here. At all. Ever.  Because people can get pills and just go on Tinder.  Right?  You don&amp;#39;t seem to understand supply and demand, and when shown that restrictions have no effect &amp;amp; result in substitution you handwave it away.   Heavier weapons show up in war zones because there&amp;#39;s a demand for them.  You turn the US into a warzone, guess what?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Metal working, injection molding and chemistry require tools, equipment, and skills to use that the average person doesn\u2019t have. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dude, c&amp;#39;mon.  &lt;a href=\"http://www.theflatspot.net/mac10---45-lower-receiver-flat.html\"&gt;MAC-10s are essentially sheet metal&lt;/a&gt; and any machine shop can crank these out.  You seriously think this is going to be more difficult than an industrial grow op for weed? Making lab grade meth?  The injection molding is for modern era designs like glocks - people blasted each other for decades with 1911s and BARs.  And again, a Sten is just metal tube. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It being &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; to go to a gun store is why homebrew stuff isn&amp;#39;t showing up.  When it&amp;#39;s difficult, demand will create incentive for supply to be replenished via other sources.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is more difficult than snorting blow, but do you think that if every coke head out there had the skills and know how to manufacture their own coke, wouldn\u2019t they be doing it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh so now your recognize that despite the difficulty, the illegal product is still available?  Glad to help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All of those laws WERE flimsy. It\u2019s not the number of laws, it\u2019s the substance of the laws.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you admit that the laws are security theater and didn&amp;#39;t accomplish their stated goal for stopping crime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;[Orlando]Again, you cannot ever completely control someone\u2019s behavior. These laws would have weeded out a large number of people. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you started this thread specifically about &amp;quot;mass shootings&amp;quot; - this guy specifically abided by every single law you could want, many of them not &amp;quot;flimsy&amp;quot; and still committed the worst mass shooting in US history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, large number of people would have been weeded out, the vast majority of them &lt;strong&gt;never would have committed any crimes to begin with&lt;/strong&gt;.

Still, forcing people to manufacture a firearm is more difficult than someone just buying one. Yes, of course there will be SOME people with the skill and know how to handcraft a relatively functional firearm, MOST people can\u2019t. You\u2019re talking about skills and equipment that most people don\u2019t have. \n\n&gt;You understand that the receiver is currently the only part tracked, yes? And that none of the other parts are particularly difficult to manufacture, right? Springs, sears, hammers, all easily done with hand tools\n\nYes, I know that the receiver is the only part that is tracked. That is why I proposed regulating the rest of the parts as well. springs, sears, and hammers may be done with hand tools but what about the barrel, bolt and bolt carrier group? You just ignored the most difficult parts of the gun to manufacture. Even someone making springs, sears, and hammers as you said will have a more difficult time doing that then just buying them, but you ignored the most difficult parts of a gun to manufacture. \n\nThe phillipines are a very different country than the United States. Their president gave the ok for people to kill others if they merely suspected them of being a drug dealer. The government in the phillipines, including the police force is a lot weaker than the Government in the United States. \n\nFrom the article you just linked: \n\n\u201cThe Philippines does not provide specific data on gun-related homicides. Offenses involving women and minors are significantly under counted and most police stations don\u2019t have official desk blotters to record crimes, according to findings released by the national police in June.\u201d \n\nTheir police force and their government  is weak\n\n\n\u201cThe nation faces entrenched Muslim rebellions and a Maoist guerrilla group, not to mention hired killers and more than 100 private armies according to Amnesty International.\u201d\n\nthis is something the United states doesn\u2019t have to deal with\n\n\u201cWe have weak law enforcement and that\u2019s where patronage politics and crony capitalism come in. The first ones to own a gun are the rich, then the criminals, and ordinary people who feel the police can\u2019t protect them.\u201d\n\nNot something we have to deal with in the states\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur system remains feudal and we have no rule of law,\u201d Ramon Casiple, executive director of the Institute for Political and Electoral Reform in Manila, said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s where the image of the Wild West comes from,\u201d said Casiple, who advises an elite police unit that deals with high-profile crimes on how to modernize.\u201d\n\n\nthe Phillipines is dealing with issues that we do not deal with, specifically political homicides surrounding their elections. \n\nAfghanistan is a 3rd world country, the United States isn\u2019t. \n\nForcing people to manufacture illegal firearms would drive them underground. instead of just being able to buy guns, you\u2019re now talking about someone manufacturing them in a basement somewhere. \n\nAgain, you keep trying to make it sound like anybody can make a firearm, even a very sophisticated firearm with little effort. The people making guns in the phillipines and in kyber pass are skilled tradesmen, who have been passing this knowledge down for generations. In the case of the phillipines the article mentioned this happening even in the 20th century. \n\n\n&gt;It doesn't take a lot of people or skill. It's literally high school auto shop level knowledge that is easier than turning brake rotors. You can't control raw materials when you can build a machinegun from tubing from Home Depot. You'd understand this is an impossible task if you had even a layman's level of knowledge on this topic, and we haven't even touched on how you are going to \"regulate\" small parts made out of sheet metal.\n\nMaybe to make certain types of firearms, but the same types of firearms we can buy legally at a gun store? I don\u2019t think so. As far as small parts made out of sheet metal, again you are referring to parts that would only contribute to part of the gun, not the whole thing. Explain how someone is going to manufacture a rifle barrel, and a bolt, and a bolt carrier group, the buffer tube, the buffer, the delta ring, the gas tube, all of these other parts of the firearm, and then again, tell me how easy this is for even a layman to do. \n\n&gt;Watch what happens when the legal supply is cut off. See: Drugs, War on.\n\nWe\u2019re also talking here about regulating something, not banning it outright. Prohibition in the US didn\u2019t work because again, we completely banned something, not regulated it. I\u2019m not talking about completely banning ALL firearms, I\u2019m talking about enforcing stricter and more meaningful regulations. \n\nAlso, consuming drugs is a very different thing from obtaining a weapon. Drugs are addictive, which is what keeps the drug trade going. You don\u2019t go into withdrawals if you don\u2019t buy a new gun every day. The nature of the object in question is different. Drugs are different than guns. \n\n&gt;Oh, word? How long do you think a firearm can last for exactly? Here's a WWII STG44 that was turned in to a police buyback in 2014 that was still functional. It'd be hanging out in someone's closet. And check out the sweet Sten this homeless dude had in his shopping basket (with custom oil filter silencer, natch!).\n\nYeah, of course there will always be some weird obscure firearms around. Of course the shelf life of a firearm is extremely long, almost unlimited. but again, you\u2019re forgetting that we have an active police force, that actively takes guns off the streets. You\u2019re forgetting that the types of guns most street criminals have are extremely old, in various states of disrepair. You\u2019re forgetting that most criminals caught with guns don\u2019t even have a full magazine of ammo, and are sometimes caught with the wrong caliber in the gun. Our street criminals who cannot buy guns legally are not well equipped.

That doesn\u2019t mean that there are 350 million people with guns. I\u2019m also more worried about people who are buying new firearms than I am worried about everyone who already owns guns. \n\n&gt; Google up guns seized in Mexico and you'll see pictures of all manner of machineguns, grenade launchers and other completely prohibited ordance including RPGs because criminals don't care about laws\n\nMexico is a very different country from the United States, the same way that the Phillipines are a very different country than the United States. As far as specifically where people in mexico are getting RPG\u2019s, machine guns, and grenade launchers? these are not the type of weapons that prohibited persons in the United States are able to get. Most of the guns street criminals have here are handguns, shotguns, and rifles.\n\n in Afghanistan and Iraq they have full auto AK\u2019s, PKM\u2019s, and rpg\u2019s because they basically don\u2019t have a standing government, and of course they are openly trading with Pakistan who is actively equipping ISIS, those types of guns were mass produced by Russia and sold all over the world. \nWe don\u2019t see a lot of those types of weapons at all in the United states because we have a very strong, standing government. Civilians here are not going to be able to get there hands on RPG\u2019S and belt fed machine guns and grenade launchers. If they could, they already would. \n\n&gt;So you aren't going to also ban the metalworking / injection molding knowledge to manufacture these guns along with the chemistry aspect? Then you truly haven't considered the practical requirements for your proposal.\n\nMetal working, injection molding and chemistry require tools, equipment, and skills to use that the average person doesn\u2019t have. Again, you\u2019re trying to make this sound easy, but metal working, injection molding and chemistry ain\u2019t as easy as walking down to the gun store and filling out a 4473. \n\n&gt;Sure, just like growing &amp; processing cocaine is significantly more difficult than snorting blow, but still, somehow, coke is cheaper and more pure in the US than it was in the 80s. People still make meth despite restrictions on sudafed. All it takes is a couple guys with the knowledge, and some dudes waving dollar bills, and presto - guns.\n\nIt is more difficult than snorting blow, but do you think that if every coke head out there had the skills and know how to manufacture their own coke, wouldn\u2019t they be doing it? \n\nIf we allowed people to buy all of the meth making supplies they wanted to, and we didn\u2019t have any laws or regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of meth, people would make more meth than they currently do. People would make A LOT more meth than they currently do, if everything they could buy was legal, and if they weren\u2019t constantly worried about the cops showing up. Again, the draw for hard drugs is different than the draw for guns, because people are addicted to drugs. \n\n&gt;Oh, word? Well then, my guy, let's look at the \"flimsy\" laws that failed to prevent the San Bernardino shooting:\n\n  All of those laws WERE flimsy.

There's 350 million guns in private hands dude, and around 11k homicides a year, many of those connected to the drug trade.  Google up guns seized in Mexico and you'll see pictures of all manner of machineguns, grenade launchers and other completely prohibited ordance including RPGs *because criminals don't care about laws*.  Guns aren't going to dry up just like **DRUGS HAVEN'T DRIED UP.**\n\n&gt; In what way would the 1st amendment be gutted by doing any of the things I talked about in my post?\n\nSo you aren't going to also ban the metalworking / injection molding knowledge to manufacture these guns along with the chemistry aspect?

Forcing people to do these things will prevent mass shootings from happening if the person is unable to manufacture, import, or steal a firearm.\n\nOh, word?  Well then, my guy, let's look at the \"flimsy\" laws that failed to prevent the San Bernardino shooting:\n\n* Universal Background Checks.\n* Assault Weapons Ban\n* High Capacity Magazine Ban\n* Detachable magazine ban on rifles\n* Mandatory safety testing before purchasing a gun\n* Mandatory handgun registration\n* Mandatory long gun registration\n* Mandatory waiting periods after purchasing\n* One gun a month purchasing limits\n* Ban on open carry\n* Defacto ban against concealed carry through \"may issue\" laws\n* Total prohibition against pipe bombs\n\nOr Orlando:\n\n* The shooter bought his guns at a gun store, where he was background checked. \n* He had a concealed carry permit, for which he was background checked. \n* He had a state firearms license, for which he was background checked. \n* He was also an armed security guard for a government contractor which required an active security clearance, for which he was (you guessed it) background checked.\n* Somewhere in the last two he had to have 60 hours of training and a medical exam that certified he had no issues.\n* The FBI interviewed him, twice, and investigated him for 10 months. He wasn't on the Terrorist Watchlist either - they pulled him off after they didn't find anything actionable.\n\nThat guy was the poster child for every gun control law you could imagine. Still slaughtered dozens.\n\nOr look at Anders Breivik.  \n\n&gt; You're making manufacturing a firearm sound extremely easy. If you're talking about manufacturing an entire firearm from scratch, it is not. If you're talking about manufacturing a receiver and then buying the rest of the parts and assembling it, regulating every other functional component of a gun would take care of that and prevent it from happening.\n\nDude, the Sten was designed so it could be made in basements by partisans in crappy conditions.  The most difficult part to make of a MAC10 is the barrel, everything else is just welded steel plate and some easy work done to steel... all capable of being done in a drill press.  \n\nBy restricting legal supply, you haven't reduced the motives behind bloodshed.  As others stated, people will just use bombs, or [completely-not-background-checked gasoline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Land_fire), or steal the guns, or [drive trucks through crowds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Nice_attack), or just ignore your laws and [bring in guns from elsewhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_2015_Paris_attacks).\n\n**I sympathize with your goal.

So, let me offer the Canadian perspective.  For background, I'm a Canadian gun owner and also am a lawyer who practices in firearms law out here.  \n\nSo, let's talk about what Canadian law does:\n\n* Licensing of all gun owners, required before you can acquire firearms or ammunition.  So, universal background checks.  \n\n* Magazine limits of 10 rounds for handguns, 5 rounds for semi-auto rifles/shotguns.\n\n* Registration of handguns as well as some other long guns (including the AR-15, not including the Tavor and a bunch of others).  \n\nSo, some things you miss here, first of all:  \n\n* AR-15s are pretty commonly used sporting rifles.  In fact, the term \"sporting rifle\" was pretty much developed to capture the center fire semi-auto rifle with smaller cartridges.  They're used in a variety of shooting sports.  Also for some hunting things, and varmint control.  \n\n* Regulation of ammo/magazines is something no government wants to worry about, because holy shit would that be a bureaucratic nightmare.  Also, what most people think of as \"huge amounts of ammo\" if they aren't gun owners are actually fairly minimal.  I had a prosecutor once ask me why a guy had 2000 rounds of ammunition, and my answer was \"Well, he's running low...\"\n\n* Regulation of every other functional part of a firearm:  Again, this is a bureaucratic clusterfuck in actual practice.  \n\n* Mandatory registration:  We abolished our long gun registry, as it was a total failure.

So, let me offer the Canadian perspective.  For background, I&amp;#39;m a Canadian gun owner and also am a lawyer who practices in firearms law out here.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;#39;s talk about what Canadian law does:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Licensing of all gun owners, required before you can acquire firearms or ammunition.  So, universal background checks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magazine limits of 10 rounds for handguns, 5 rounds for semi-auto rifles/shotguns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registration of handguns as well as some other long guns (including the AR-15, not including the Tavor and a bunch of others).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, some things you miss here, first of all:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AR-15s are pretty commonly used sporting rifles.  In fact, the term &amp;quot;sporting rifle&amp;quot; was pretty much developed to capture the center fire semi-auto rifle with smaller cartridges.  They&amp;#39;re used in a variety of shooting sports.  Also for some hunting things, and varmint control.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulation of ammo/magazines is something no government wants to worry about, because holy shit would that be a bureaucratic nightmare.  Also, what most people think of as &amp;quot;huge amounts of ammo&amp;quot; if they aren&amp;#39;t gun owners are actually fairly minimal.  I had a prosecutor once ask me why a guy had 2000 rounds of ammunition, and my answer was &amp;quot;Well, he&amp;#39;s running low...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulation of every other functional part of a firearm:  Again, this is a bureaucratic clusterfuck in actual practice.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandatory registration:  We abolished our long gun registry, as it was a total failure.
