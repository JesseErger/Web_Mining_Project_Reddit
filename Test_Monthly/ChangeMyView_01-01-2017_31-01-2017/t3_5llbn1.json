I think that for every human problem (in regards to the brain) there is a biological explanation, even if it's not known yet. However, I'm in a bit of a struggle with myself as to wether or not I see psychology subservient. I think they're equally as valid, but just \"two voices in the discussion\". I think both are equally as important but can the answer to a problem can only be \"truth\" when both fields combine their knowledge and reach a consensus. In previous discussions, people have disagreed with me and said that if biology has an answer, then that's good enough because that's truth. Psychology should agree, and if it doesn't, then it's wrong. \nI have no idea if there has been a moment when the two fields directly contradict one another when answering the same problem\n\nI guess an example could be \"criminal behavior\", or more specifically, the desire to kill. I'm going to make something up here, because I know enough, but speaking hypothetically - let's say that a team of biologists discover that a particular hormone has a direct link to violence (more hormone means more violence and went one step further and said it therefore meant past a certain threshold, a person would be more likely to kill). However, from a psychologists perspective, they would explain the violence (not saying that biologist is incorrect) in that the person was beaten as a child and learnt that that was the way to show affection. Combining the two rhetorics as to why the specific person was violent, this would mean that when the person experienced a violent act as a child, that specific hormone would need to be present.

It sounds like you are taking about the \"nature vs nurture\" false choice, or \"genes vs environment\" which is a better description, but they do generally work in tandem. \n\nExcept that you refer to \"biology\" and \"psychology\". These are largely the same thing. Evolutionary psychology is the study of the parts of our personality, behaviours, and habits that result from genetic predisposition via natural selection. That is, it's the part of our psychology that is pre-programmed.\n\nSo it's not clear to me how you are differentiating biology and psychology. Do you mean feedback from our environment? Well, that exists too, though the process of social norming itself is pre-programmed biology/psychology.\n\nA good way of thinking about it is that we each, individually, have genetic traits, both physical and psychological, and societies tend to amplify the aligned common traits that we share, and the fringe variations are \"noise\" in society. And, since we evolved in tribal groups in competition, we have ingroup/outgroup mechanisms that include ingroup norming (one of \"us\"). You can see this in the [Robbers Cave Experiment](http://www.simplypsychology.org/robbers-cave.html), for example, where randomly assigned boys that were otherwise identical are put in different groups into competition with each other. Due to our tribalist nature, each group started to really hate the other group and both created stereotypes of their own ingroup and the outgroup, and started to behave more and more like (norm to) their own created stereotype, such avoiding swearing because swearing is what \"they\" do. In this case, the behaviour was manufactured organically and chaotically (sparked by a baseball game where one member noticed the other team swearing a few times), but the tendency to socially norm to what defines \"us\" is a pre-programmed tendency. So the swearing (or not) behaviour wasn't biological per se, but the behaviour resulted from random social chance combined with genetically/biologically pre-programmed psychology of social norming.\n\nAnother interpretation is individual traits like personality, behaviour, habits, or psychological capacities or expressions like intelligence, homosexuality, religiosity, or criminality. These are generally a mix of genetic predispositions combined with random events that can include life events (meeting a person, being in a place at a time something happens, or random in utero axon development). For example, from twin, adoptee, peers, and sibling tests, intelligence seems to be about 70% due to genes and 30% due to *unshared* environment, and close to 0% due to shared environment. Shared environment means things like household, parenting style, school, general culture, general environment. Unshared environment means things like random occurrences in the world that lead you down one path or another that strengthen neurological connections that way.\n\nFor example, you can imagine identical twins, which are genetically identical, walking to school. One drops a book and leans down to pick it up. The other brother notices a baseball flying through the air about to hit his brother and reaches out and bare-hand catches it with one hand. \n\nThe brother who dropped the book is helped by a girl he likes and, upon seeing the book, she says, \"Ooh, you must be very smart\" and smiles at him and walks away. As a result, he focuses on studying and learning and his intelligence improves from his baseline genetic predisposition for intelligence. \n\nThe brother who caught the ball has a crowd of people around him who cheer and are amazed at his athletic prowess, even though the catch was somewhat lucky. This social feedback causes a rush and he joins the baseball team and focuses on athletics, improving upon his genetic predisposition for athleticism. But he ignores academic work and doesn't strengthen his intelligence.\n\nBoth brothers have the same genetic predispositions. Both *could* be good athletes or very intelligent scientists. Random events caused them to focus on strengthening one predisposition over the other, and therefore they don't measure the same in intelligence or athletic capability, but they do *correlate* when compared to the rest of the population.\n\nThe same may be said of criminal behaviour, for example. There is certainly a genetic component, but two identical twin brothers may go different routes based on life events. One may get mixed into a peer group with criminal tendencies and becomes a lifelong criminal by strengthening those tendencies. The other may witness some tragic criminal event and/or get a lesson from a role model that stuck with them, and keeps away from crime. Two other twins who *don't* have such genetic criminal predispositions in the same events may not react the same. The one who gets in with the criminal crowd may become uncomfortable with their behaviour and later leave, for instance. The one who hears a lesson from the same role model may not have their ambition sparked. \n\nThese aren't stories of randomness, but of a combination of randomness and predisposition. I like to think of such traits and \"bonking your head\". Tall people will statistically bump their head more simply because of their height, which is genetically determined for the most part. But they need to be in an environment where there's something to hit their head on otherwise they'll never bump their head. A genetically short person will not bump their head in any of those circumstances, or at least much fewer, so environment can't make up for the lack of genetic tendency when it comes to head-bonking.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are so many ways to interpret what you&amp;#39;re saying, so I&amp;#39;ll throw out a few related suggestions.
