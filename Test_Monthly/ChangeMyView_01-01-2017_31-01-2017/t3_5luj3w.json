I would argue that 1) motivation does matter. 2) the emotional costs of telling the cheatee far outweigh the benefits of knowing the truth and finally, 3) the morally right thing to do would actually be to confront the cheater.\n\nMotivation \n\nMotivation matters because what we traditionally think of cheating to be about sex. Indeed sometimes it is. However, it's more likely according to psychologist who have studied infidelity that a cheater is instead trying to relive a part of his or her past. They believe a cheater acts out for reasons other than purely sexual reasons. Now why does that matter? They're still cheating, and cheating is wrong. The problem arises in point 2.\n\nEmotional Devastation \n\nA cheatee is essentially unable to take the news of being cheated on lightly. As I said before, we traditionally believe cheating to be a sexual thing. That means someone who finds out they're a cheatee is likely to be immediately filled with feelings of sexual inadequacy or being unattractive. What if the infidelity is emotional in nature? Similar feelings of inadequacy would surely emerge. However, because of the more personal nature, the emotional toll could be even more extreme. The same psychological writers mentioned above do not universally recommend that a cheater \"come clean\" if they stop an affair, and feel legitimately bad about it. Partly because the goal in such case would be to alleviate the guilt the cheater feels by obtaining reconciliation. That's a selfish goal considering it was the cheater who \"got us into this mess.\" \n\nSo in short, the emotional detriment to the cheatee is not worth the gains, which is even more shown by the last point.\n\nConfront the Cheater \n\nIf you feel the need to intervene in one's relationship, and believe it is the moral thing to do, why start with the victim? A far better course of action would be to confront the cheater, and try to convince him that he needs to end the relationship he cannot commit to. Ask him/her why is he cheating? Why are you doing this? What's wrong with the relationship? Maybe the cheatee is abusive or there is another issue you're not privy to. You could discover any of these things without the myriad of risks created by telling the cheatee. Imagine if the cheatee is abusive, and seriously batters the cheater that night? \n\nMinutiae \n\nThe final thing is that cheating can be likened to drug addiction in many ways. The motivation of reliving a past life as discussed earlier is part and parcel with a drug addict's struggle with staying clean. Imagine for a moment that the infidelity of a relationship was not with another person, but cocaine. So the cheater is breaking an explicit agreement with the cheatee to stay clean. Is the best course of action still to tell his wife? I don't think so. Better idea would be first to consult the addict, see what his situation is, see if he needs help, and if you can give it to him. The best way to change your view is to see the addict and cheater as people who have something in their brain keeping them from successfully maintaining close relationships.

You could discover any of these things without the myriad of risks created by telling the cheatee. Imagine if the cheatee is abusive, and seriously batters the cheater that night? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minutiae &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The final thing is that cheating can be likened to drug addiction in many ways. The motivation of reliving a past life as discussed earlier is part and parcel with a drug addict&amp;#39;s struggle with staying clean. Imagine for a moment that the infidelity of a relationship was not with another person, but cocaine. So the cheater is breaking an explicit agreement with the cheatee to stay clean. Is the best course of action still to tell his wife? I don&amp;#39;t think so. Better idea would be first to consult the addict, see what his situation is, see if he needs help, and if you can give it to him. The best way to change your view is to see the addict and cheater as people who have something in their brain keeping them from successfully maintaining close relationships. Oh, and that everyone&amp;#39;s human. Sometimes we make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbzyxaj", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5luj3w/cmv_if_you_know_someone_is_cheating_the_morally/dbzyxaj/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483587138.0, "author_flair_text": "1\u2206", "created_utc": 1483558338.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbzx9rc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheChemist158", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dbzs9qm", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I don't necessarily know anything about their motivation.
