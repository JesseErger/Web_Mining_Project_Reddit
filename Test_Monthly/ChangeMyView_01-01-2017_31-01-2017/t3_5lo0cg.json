The fundamental subjects are fundamental for a reason. I use what I learned in chemistry while cooking, when cleaning things, when working with my hobby. None of those are related to my career.\n\nDoes having a rudimentary knowledge of chemistry actually help you cook? You might have a deeper understanding of what happens, but I really doubt you can actually use a rudimentary understanding of chemistry to help you do day to day stuff. I'd like to see some examples. Sure, I know that hot water dissolves things better, but I don't need any knowledge of chemistry to tell me that. In fact, a cooking class would do a lot better at teaching me 'practical chemistry'.\n\n&gt;1. I don't believe it should be the position of a modern society to not care about critical thinking. The assumption that critical thinking is important for all people is a pretty basic one that I consider axiomatic.\n\nI think that critical thought is great for an individual and society. I just don't think you'll get it in a classroom. Some people are bad it, and those who are good pick it up elsewhere.\n\n&gt;Those people probably won't have jobs here pretty soon. If you can't think, I'm gonna replace you with a robot.\n\nRobots are expensive and AI is lacking. Are you really going to replace a stocker because he isn't good at critical thought? A burger flipper?\n\n&gt;Math is the study of how logic works.\n\n&gt;Science is the study of how the unknown works.\n\n&gt;History is the study of how things used to work.\n\n&gt;Literature is the study of how things could work.\n\nNice phrases, and true if a person really dives into a topic. But the typical high schooler learning these topics won't get a deep enough understanding of them. And even those who devolop a deeper understanding of them won't get that much practical use. I'm half way through a PhD in chemistry and my knowledge of chemistry provides very little actual utility outside of work. A deeper understanding yes, but utility? No.\n\nCcompare a chemistry class to a cooking and nutrition class. A cooking class can teach you how to make a healthy dinner, something that many people don't know how to do and leads to many health problems. You can pick out groceries and cook meals with this knowledge. Compared to what? Learning to heat something up to dissolve something?

You might have a deeper understanding of what happens, but I really doubt you can actually use a rudimentary understanding of chemistry to help you do day to day stuff. I&amp;#39;d like to see some examples. Sure, I know that hot water dissolves things better, but I don&amp;#39;t need any knowledge of chemistry to tell me that.

I just don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;ll get it in a classroom. Some people are bad it, and those who are good pick it up elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Those people probably won&amp;#39;t have jobs here pretty soon. If you can&amp;#39;t think, I&amp;#39;m gonna replace you with a robot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robots are expensive and AI is lacking.

But the typical high schooler learning these topics won&amp;#39;t get a deep enough understanding of them. And even those who devolop a deeper understanding of them won&amp;#39;t get that much practical use. I&amp;#39;m half way through a PhD in chemistry and my knowledge of chemistry provides very little actual utility outside of work. A deeper understanding yes, but utility? No.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ccompare a chemistry class to a cooking and nutrition class. A cooking class can teach you how to make a healthy dinner, something that many people don&amp;#39;t know how to do and leads to many health problems. You can pick out groceries and cook meals with this knowledge. Compared to what? Learning to heat something up to dissolve something?

For most parents, it is probably that they want a daycare like option, but also want their kid to go to \"school\". Regardless of the parent's reasoning, the purpose of pre-k is to give children basic social interaction skills. Basic social skills would probably be considered a basic life function. Why does pre-k focus on this so much? Because at that young age, information cannot be readily accepted by children's brains, not because they are stupid but because up until that point they where never required to. Take for example a school in my area called \"Dumbledorf\"(not the real name). At Dumbldorf, the reading of books is not taught until the child is about 7, or in the first/second grade. This is because up until that time, what would be equivalent to kindergarden and first grade, most of what the child does is learning how to express him/herself. It seems a trend that trouble adults who commit crimes also have a trouble childhood. Making the child be creative and learn how to express their emotions in a safe an healthy manner is *beyond* important for the development of the child, and what I would consider a basic life function.\n\nA more direct answer to your CMV is yes, what you said was the purpose of education system *is* the point. That's because the education system, more in junior high/high school, is more about giving the student an opportunity to take a new class, say Medical Microbiology, and say \"I never knew that ... was because of ... , maybe I'll become a Doctor/Researcher/Nurse/Anesthesiologist/etc\". School is, at this stage, giving a small taste of some future jobs in the real world. And so yes, you're right in that it is not the education system's job to teach students about the inner finesses of the 1040-EZ, however you're also wrong about what the purpose of the education system is. The education system never has one defining theme overall, for different age groups it serves a different purpose.\n\ntl;dr The education system does not exist for teaching someone how to do taxes, however there isn't an overarching theme which can be simplified into the two topics you give above. The education system gives different aged children different goals, some of which is what you said up there. The two goals you mention above would be applied to junior high/high school children, along with advanced language application, understanding the would we live in through math and science, and sexual transitions, while more appropriate goals for elementary school children would be basic application of language, social interactions, healthy expressions of oneself. \n\nSummary: You are correct in that the education system isn't designed for teaching specifics of living, the education system changes depending on the age of the child, and the goals you mentioned are part of the upper level of that education.\n\n-From a former child(sorry for rambling)", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree with you that your two points of learning are what is intended in the education system, to some extent.

It seems a trend that trouble adults who commit crimes also have a trouble childhood. Making the child be creative and learn how to express their emotions in a safe an healthy manner is &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; important for the development of the child, and what I would consider a basic life function.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A more direct answer to your CMV is yes, what you said was the purpose of education system &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the point. That&amp;#39;s because the education system, more in junior high/high school, is more about giving the student an opportunity to take a new class, say Medical Microbiology, and say &amp;quot;I never knew that ... was because of ... , maybe I&amp;#39;ll become a Doctor/Researcher/Nurse/Anesthesiologist/etc&amp;quot;. School is, at this stage, giving a small taste of some future jobs in the real world. And so yes, you&amp;#39;re right in that it is not the education system&amp;#39;s job to teach students about the inner finesses of the 1040-EZ, however you&amp;#39;re also wrong about what the purpose of the education system is. The education system never has one defining theme overall, for different age groups it serves a different purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr The education system does not exist for teaching someone how to do taxes, however there isn&amp;#39;t an overarching theme which can be simplified into the two topics you give above. The education system gives different aged children different goals, some of which is what you said up there. The two goals you mention above would be applied to junior high/high school children, along with advanced language application, understanding the would we live in through math and science, and sexual transitions, while more appropriate goals for elementary school children would be basic application of language, social interactions, healthy expressions of oneself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary: You are correct in that the education system isn&amp;#39;t designed for teaching specifics of living, the education system changes depending on the age of the child, and the goals you mentioned are part of the upper level of that education.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-From a former child(sorry for rambling)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbxlrr0", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lo0cg/cmv_it_is_not_the_point_of_the_education_system/dbxlrr0/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483448418.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483419618.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lo0cg", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbxqr52", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "anneoftheisland", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5lo0cg", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Most of those things have much larger societal applications than simply personal finance or personal civics.

This was because their household servants as well as &amp;quot;family lawyers&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;landlords&amp;quot; would do all other jobs for them, like driving them, filling out their taxes, changing their car tires, polishing their shoes, driving them around town, fixing their sinks and electronics etc. Their wives, upon marriage, were meant to set them three meals a day, laundry and press their clothes, sew buttons in when needed, and dust the house. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Education&amp;quot; was never meant for women, or any man below upper-middle class. It was meant for top 20% of the society, while the bottom 80% served them. These bottom 80% were &amp;quot;street-smart&amp;quot; and not educated, and many didn&amp;#39;t even know their letters and numbers, and yet, had stable jobs in service.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the &amp;quot;Old Days&amp;quot;, our lives have gradually changed. Today, one hand, our career involved highly specialized knowledge, which comes from talent, experience and mentorship and of course Google. And on the other hand, we all have to individually share our own chores - which involves tremendous amount of work for one single person without having servants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, the kind of life our System was meant for and the kind of life we have today have diverged and it is expected millenials are complaining about it. Today, it is more useful for a high-schooler to drop out and join his Dad&amp;#39;s garage, or start washing dishes at a restaurant, or become a Bank Teller at an unpaid internship and gradually rise up by making connections, rather then learn organic chemistry or integrals. Not that this knowledge is not useful, but they can be searched online on-demand.
