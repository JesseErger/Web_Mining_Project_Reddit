It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if the nine essential amino acids have to come from different sources as it can be just as easy as getting from two foods options vs. one. In fact, in a cultural sense, it already happens: beans &amp;amp; rice, peanut butter and bread, or basically any legume along with any grain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Iron is also easy to get if you eat the right foods: oats, beans, cereal.

Notice this already happens culturally like with protein.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the main arguments against living without meat would be the lack of B12 which is completely true, but pills are readily available for vegans, and vegetarians can get enough if they eat enough eggs, dairy, fortified cereal, or fortified drinks.

Most vegetarians/vegans will go straight to saying how you can eat walnuts or flax rather than fish to get Omega 3, which is true. Most would respond those are poor sources because they are ALA which has to become DHA/EPA. You get the Omega 3 either way, but if you are worried about your Omega 3 to Omega 6 ratio, because having Omega 6 in your system makes the ALA to DHA/EPA conversion slower (whole other thing I&amp;#39;m not gonna get into) you can opt for DHA/EPA Omega 3 from algae which can come in pill form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could go on and talk about how you don&amp;#39;t need dairy either but that&amp;#39;s another argument.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: To be clear, you have to make sure you get the right amount of calories too (eat enough) as you can&amp;#39;t get by on just bread or salad.
