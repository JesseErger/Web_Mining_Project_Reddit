On the other hand, you have Bernie, a man who is only part of the Democratic party because it was convenient.

But neither is it a non-functioning state, corrupt to the point where nothing works. In fact, it's one of the best run countries in the world once you consider in the fact that it's the world's largest economy, where most people do actually have access to education and jobs, where almost nobody dies of famine, with the choice to believe whatever they want and the press has the freedom to print whatever they please about anyone.\n\nAgain, your home country of Nicaragua was at the time, deemed a threat to US interests, and therefore the USA acted against it. This is done in US interests, not Nicaraguan interests. Naturally it would have been in the Nicaraguan govt's interests to unite against a potentially hostile foreign interests as well.

Often times this means cooperating with America's allies, soothing tensions between China, Russia and other nations.
