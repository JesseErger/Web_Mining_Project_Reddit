Personally, the only reason I own an XB1 is because I like the games that are more geared towards console.\n\nYeah but all those games also come out on pc, and with a reasonable setup enjoyed the same way, often better. As I mentioned, exclusives are really keeping consoles alive, along with pretty shitty pre-built providers making a lot of easy purchase computers not all that attractive. That niche may not be going away for a bit, but make no mistake, it will disappear eventually and Sony and Microsoft know it.\n\n&gt;but they aren't commercial failures. The Wii U is.\n\nAbsolutely, but the vita was a failure and the 3DS is still great. Nintendo realized the wii u wasn't worth it and abandoned it, they have been struggling with home consoles for a while now, despite a bounce back with the wii(the most toy like of all). Now consider this: Sony and Microsoft are monstorous industry giants, nintendo, while big, does not have the disposable resources to get and compete in terms of exclusives in that market. It's far more of a risk for them. That's one reason Nintendo has so many first party games.\n\nSo the switch has the gimmick of being a handheld, and if it's supposed to be their new flagship handheld, I'm totally expecting it to be a huge success. I disagree with you about the handheld market dying, sun and moon sales numbers really show it's alive and healthy.

Personally, the only reason I own an XB1 is because I like the games that are more geared towards console.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah but all those games also come out on pc, and with a reasonable setup enjoyed the same way, often better. As I mentioned, exclusives are really keeping consoles alive, along with pretty shitty pre-built providers making a lot of easy purchase computers not all that attractive. That niche may not be going away for a bit, but make no mistake, it will disappear eventually and Sony and Microsoft know it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;but they aren&amp;#39;t commercial failures. The Wii U is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Absolutely, but the vita was a failure and the 3DS is still great. Nintendo realized the wii u wasn&amp;#39;t worth it and abandoned it, they have been struggling with home consoles for a while now, despite a bounce back with the wii(the most toy like of all). Now consider this: Sony and Microsoft are monstorous industry giants, nintendo, while big, does not have the disposable resources to get and compete in terms of exclusives in that market. It&amp;#39;s far more of a risk for them. That&amp;#39;s one reason Nintendo has so many first party games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the switch has the gimmick of being a handheld, and if it&amp;#39;s supposed to be their new flagship handheld, I&amp;#39;m totally expecting it to be a huge success. I disagree with you about the handheld market dying, sun and moon sales numbers really show it&amp;#39;s alive and healthy. Mobile gaming and handhelds are so drastically different that it&amp;#39;s almost not comparable. Super Mario run was released on iOS, super Mario maker 3D was released on 3ds.

If you don't, you decide pros and cons between PS4/XB1/PC for comparable experiences\n\nNintendo has purely unique features. the wiimotes and the gamepad make for something that you can't do on other consoles or even PC. you can treat the gamepad as a mobile device and go play somewhere without a tv. the wiimotes are simple to use. you basically have 2 buttons and motion control. most of their games are also exclusives. they are some of the best known franchises to ever exist, and with few exceptions (like pokemon go and mario run) are entirely exclusive to their consoles. play station had some good exclusives for the PS2 like Ratchet and Clank and Sly Cooper, but other than that from what I can tell, an exclusive to the PS4 or XBONE is simply a different war shooter franchise or racing game that you can find most anywhere else.\n\nI personally opted out of buying the last generation of consoles in lieu of a PC that costs not much more than either PS4 or XBONE at launch, but has far superior graphics, and the option to use mouse/keyboard (which is arguably the best format for FPS games). I did buy the Wii U, however.

If you don&amp;#39;t, you decide pros and cons between PS4/XB1/PC for comparable experiences&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nintendo has purely unique features. the wiimotes and the gamepad make for something that you can&amp;#39;t do on other consoles or even PC. you can treat the gamepad as a mobile device and go play somewhere without a tv. the wiimotes are simple to use. you basically have 2 buttons and motion control. most of their games are also exclusives. they are some of the best known franchises to ever exist, and with few exceptions (like pokemon go and mario run) are entirely exclusive to their consoles. play station had some good exclusives for the PS2 like Ratchet and Clank and Sly Cooper, but other than that from what I can tell, an exclusive to the PS4 or XBONE is simply a different war shooter franchise or racing game that you can find most anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I personally opted out of buying the last generation of consoles in lieu of a PC that costs not much more than either PS4 or XBONE at launch, but has far superior graphics, and the option to use mouse/keyboard (which is arguably the best format for FPS games). I did buy the Wii U, however.

On both the Wii and Wii U, games made by Nintendo are not only great but utilize their console in the best way possible. So if Nintendo could find developer support that are willing to put in the work to make great games, then their consoles won&amp;#39;t see as bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbv4jq4", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5ldtw3/cmv_nintendo_needs_to_drop_the_gimmick_and_just/dbv4jq4/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483298458.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483269658.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5ldtw3", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbvk4q9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "eternallylearning", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5ldtw3", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I don't think the gimmicks themselves are the problem as with even the Wii-U, 3rd parties could have pretty much just ignored the gamepad if they wanted to.

But if I were interested in what Xbox or Playstation provides, I would just get a gaming PC that can do it better. Nintendo &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; a niche and identity; it is the other consoles facing the identity crisis.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbvo5dh", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5ldtw3/cmv_nintendo_needs_to_drop_the_gimmick_and_just/dbvo5dh/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483335753.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483306953.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5ldtw3", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5ldtw3", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbwbo1g", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LesFirewall", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dbvyd74", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I feel this way about Pokemon and the 3DS, but nintendo has an aging audience because of the rise of smartphones so this isn't a good longterm strategy. \n\nLol thats what happens when I type on mobile", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel this way about Pokemon and the 3DS, but nintendo has an aging audience because of the rise of smartphones so this isn&amp;#39;t a good longterm strategy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lol thats what happens when I type on mobile&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbwbo1g", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5ldtw3/cmv_nintendo_needs_to_drop_the_gimmick_and_just/dbwbo1g/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483373028.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483344228.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbvyd74", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sw4rmlord", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5ldtw3", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Wii U owner here.
