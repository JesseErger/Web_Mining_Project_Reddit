Who is doing this?  Who is JUST hiring to fulfill a quota?  Many employers use diversity as a consideration, but I've never heard of it used as the main deciding factor.  I agree with you here.  Employers shouldn't use JUST race, but I don't think anyone believes that or at least it is held by very few very extreme individuals.\n\nYour points seem to point to that you don't believe it should even be considered, which is a much weaker point and I actually disagree with you here.\n\nMy work has a cafeteria.  Looking around the cafeteria you see a lot of different diversity preferences.  Some people sit at tables with all the same gender, some with all the same race and others with mixed gender and race tables.  My chinese coworker gets lunch with an all chinese group a few times a week even though they are all from different departments.  Some people also intentionally like to sit at mixed gender or mixed race tables. Having people find connections like this is extremely important to a work community.  Not only does this provide an opportunity to have different departments talking more frequently to each other helping make the company more efficient, but it also helps provide those people with a better sense of community and connection with the company.\n\nA workplace isn't just about each person being the most qualified themselves.  It is about creating a team that works well together.  Imagine my company is mostly male.  This would cause several problems such as any people who like sitting at gender mixed tables might not have that option.  Suppose there is a great female candidate I want to hire to the executive team.   Don't you think as a female executive she might at times feel a bit isolated by having so few other females in the workplace?  Wouldn't it not have been better to give a slight leg up to underrepresented females in the hiring process so that my eventual hire of a female executive will stick around longer and men who want a gender mixed lunch table can have that and men that want to just sit with other men can have that too?\n\nDiverse hiring isn't about blindly hiring just based on race.  It is about taking a couple of your marginal ethnic candidates and hiring them instead of some of your marginal white candidates even though they weren't quite as good in order to foster a better workplace where people can feel more connected.\n\nNot everyone cares about either sitting at a diverse or not diverse table, but some people do and it is important for their sense of connection that that is available.

Do you have any instances of businesses putting in quotas or hiring a minority who is significantly less qualified than another applicant who is white? If anything the minority is less likely to get a job when they are equally qualified. It&amp;#39;s not like there are companies who are hiring people for skilled positions with just a high school degree over someone with a college degree just because the person with a high school degree is a minority. There are also no quotas in the article you linked to about Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was also trying to point out that setting out to specifically hire woman or a minority can be in the best interest of the business. In those cases part of the merit the individual has is the fact that they are diverse from the people who are already in the business. If the minority is able to give a new view that ends up growing the business more than a candidate who does not bring diversity. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc8vofr", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5n5l9t/cmv_i_dont_think_companies_should_have_to_hire_to/dc8vofr/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1484094699.0, "author_flair_text": "41\u2206", "created_utc": 1484065899.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc8uo1h", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "vinniethepooh2", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc8t6g3", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I don't question why diversity is a good thing, I'm for it, but to put it above merit I feel is wrong.
