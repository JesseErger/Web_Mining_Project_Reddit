It&amp;#39;s a philosophy that the Republicans have held onto ever since opposing FDR&amp;#39;s New Deal, which was written to give more power to the common man.

In North Carolina, after a Democrat was elected Governor, the still-Republican state government enacted dozens of laws designed to hamper his power, limit the number of people he can actually bring into office, and in general cripple his actual influence on NC&amp;#39;s government. While I personally can&amp;#39;t speak for Hillary and her role in Benghazi, the fact that the committee built to investigate it was disbanded less than a few weeks after the election basically proved that the Republican obsession over it was a glorified smear campaign. And, of course, the Repubs are perfectly fine with a foreign power influencing the election if it&amp;#39;s done in their favor.

There&amp;#39;s no doubt that the common man needs a voice in Congress, but the Republican party is certainly not the party to be one. And it feels sad, just because I really believed that America was beyond this sort of mudslinging and backstabbing - if the Repubs actually lost this election, they may actually have had to rethink their current platform.
