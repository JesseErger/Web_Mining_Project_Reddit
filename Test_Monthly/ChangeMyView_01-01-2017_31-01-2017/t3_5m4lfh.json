A couple making the decision to have a parent stay home should look into more than just what saves money right now. Looking only at immediate costs is a short-term view that isn't financially responsible; one should look at the overall situation and consider both short and long term (which might mean priviledging the cheaper option in the end but it shouldn't be the only aspect that goes into the analysis).\n\n(To be clear, I do agree that not getting married can be beneficial financially and the better choice in some circumstances.

A couple making the decision to have a parent stay home should look into more than just what saves money right now. Looking only at immediate costs is a short-term view that isn&amp;#39;t financially responsible; one should look at the overall situation and consider both short and long term (which might mean priviledging the cheaper option in the end but it shouldn&amp;#39;t be the only aspect that goes into the analysis).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(To be clear, I do agree that not getting married can be beneficial financially and the better choice in some circumstances.
