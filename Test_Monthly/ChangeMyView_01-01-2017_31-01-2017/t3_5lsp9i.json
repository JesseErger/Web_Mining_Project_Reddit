Christian Conservative - The obvious social issue voter that will lock-step vote conservatively because of one or more of the following: Guns, Abortion, and Muslim-flavored Terrorism.  This is an Ethnocentric worldview and only thinks in absolutes \"with us or against us\", \"good vs evil\", \"abortion IS murder\" etc etc.  They listen to Rush, an christian talk radio etc.\n2. Pro business and economics-focused Modernists.  These can span both sides of the political spectrum in the form of \"Wall St Republicans\" or \"Blue Dog Democrats\"  The conflated difference will be those interested in science in an academic nature i.e. those that take global warming seriously, or believe in united-nations-type (read: global oriented or Worldcentric) solutions  will lean left and those that are your standard Liberterian-philosophy purists will lean right.  Both read the Wall St Journal, but the righties often still listen to Rush Limbaugh.\n3. Post-modernist egalitarians - This is your more far-left Democrat base.  They see value in pure \"equality for everybody\", and think overwhelmingly in Worldcentric viewpoints.  This is where real criticism of ones own state (in the Western world at least) takes its foothold and thrives.  Very anti-corporate and \"its all crony old-rich-white-guys-are-evil capitalism\" themed media here.

Both read the Wall St Journal, but the righties often still listen to Rush Limbaugh.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Post-modernist egalitarians - This is your more far-left Democrat base.

There were a few reputable newspapers and TV anchors, and if you got the news from them, you were correctly informed.  Before *then*, there were just newspapers, and they made shit up to sell issues; it was called yellow journalism.

While clearly the US was aching for some imperialism and just needed an excuse, the excuse that it did use wasn't just based on faulty intelligence like the Iraq war (the parallels would be uncanny if they were surprising) but was simply invented to sell papers.\n\nBut in the last few years, propaganda has been turned up again.  Since people don't really watch the news much anymore, preferring to get their news from Facebook, and since certain people (Sarah Palin, Donald Trump) have started demonizing the \"lamestream media\", these formerly respected voices are no longer respected.

Fake news is cynically filling that gap for people who are too stupid (or too embedded in their echo chambers) to discern reality from fantasy.\n\nRight now, Fox News is one of the most trusted name in news.  This is *bad*, because Fox News is a Republican mouthpiece (actually even more so now that Megyn Kelly left for NBC) that may not be fake news exactly but it's certainly biased in the extreme.  But why is it the most trusted name in news?  Because, compared to all the fake news in the right-wing world, it's the \"adult\" in the room.\n\nFake news isn't just some crackpot spouting nonsense, or obvious satire like the whole thing about the Bat Boy (whose story even spawned a hit musical with a second act so fucked up even Shakespeare would have been, like, \"daaaamn\").  If it were, it would be easy to ignore.  The problem is that this fake news has relatively mainstream currency among conservatives.  They think Alex Jones is actually right.  They actually believe in the conspiracy theories.  They somehow believe that Hillary is behind those conspiracies and Trump is somehow not.

Traditionally, the news networks (and newspapers) have been gatekeepers for news.  If a news story was not deemed credible, it would not be published.  Is this censorship?  A worthwhile goal is to separate out *actual* news from fake news.  That's not censorship.  If you want to know about how they're keeping Hitler's brain alive inside a jar, hey, you can read it in the weekly Midnight Star!  But curating services, including Facebook, are right to label things as real news or as fake news.  It's not censorship; it's categorization.  Your education efforts simply won't work -- people just aren't receptive to that kind of thing.  They believe what they believe and mere logic isn't going to change that.  But some sort of vetting process where reputable experts can determine if a story is true or false is a good way to stop or slow the spread of misinformation.  A credulous person will see \"this story has been determined to be fake\" and already start out biased against it.

Traditionally, the news networks (and newspapers) have been gatekeepers for news.  If a news story was not deemed credible, it would not be published.  Is this censorship?  A worthwhile goal is to separate out &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; news from fake news.  That&amp;#39;s not censorship.  If you want to know about how they&amp;#39;re keeping Hitler&amp;#39;s brain alive inside a jar, hey, you can read it in the weekly Midnight Star!  But curating services, including Facebook, are right to label things as real news or as fake news.  It&amp;#39;s not censorship; it&amp;#39;s categorization.  Your education efforts simply won&amp;#39;t work -- people just aren&amp;#39;t receptive to that kind of thing.  They believe what they believe and mere logic isn&amp;#39;t going to change that.  But some sort of vetting process where reputable experts can determine if a story is true or false is a good way to stop or slow the spread of misinformation.  A credulous person will see &amp;quot;this story has been determined to be fake&amp;quot; and already start out biased against it.  I think solid independent thought is too much to ask; people need to be steered in the right direction.  With a system like this, fake news will be less profitable (monetarily or politically) to produce and therefore there will be a lot less of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbytrkf", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lsp9i/cmv_misinformation_or_fake_news_is_only_on_the/dbytrkf/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483518658.0, "author_flair_text": "21\u2206", "created_utc": 1483489858.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lsp9i", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbygiw0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bguy74", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5lsp9i", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I think there are _many_ changes beyond information access that confound your theory a bit, although I generally agree that yours is a huge factor:\n\n1.
