For example, I might have the belief that eating organic foods is healthy, and only buy organic products. But underneath that I would know that it is only a belief I have and it may later be shown to be wrong: maybe lab grown meat would later be shown to be inorganic but healthy. Another example that is a classic: Newtonian mechanics worked very well but they were only an approximation and now we have special and general relativity to understand how atoms behave.

The religious person might say that it is very necessary that a person hold that belief, and that this belief should be internalized into oneself and taken to the grave. I&amp;#39;m just using those major denominational beliefs as a counter example to my View. You can discuss religion or religious belief for sake of argument, but no attempting to convince anyone of any particular religious belief in the comments, there are other places for that (like Youtube comment section).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So basically, my view is that I should always be ready to ditch a belief/view, but some beliefs or views are useful (and I of course have my own beliefs) so it is fine to act on them.

When you are trying to solve a problem, you are spending a lot of these resources to experimenting with a combination of statements to see if they solve your problem.  You could even say you are in some sense &amp;#39;searching&amp;#39; through a sea of possibilities hoping to land on a true statement that says &amp;#39;this is the solution&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a fair representation (i think) of the mind to say that the mind takes some &amp;#39;base&amp;#39; knowledge of the problem at hand and tries to combine it systematically until reaching a solution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re suggesting dramatically increasing the number of &amp;#39;base&amp;#39; statements that your mind will have to use to search for the solution.  The growth of &amp;#39;potential statements&amp;#39; based on &amp;#39;base&amp;#39; statements is exponential, meaning that if you have twice as many base statements, depending on how deep your search goes, you might have a hundred times as many possibilities to consider.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your brain cannot cover all of those possibilities.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR;\nTo put it more simply, if you asked a chess player to be absolutely, 100 percent, without a sliver of doubt certain of the outcome of his next move on the game, he would never be able to make a move, he&amp;#39;d be too busy checking the contingencies that he wouldn&amp;#39;t normally spend time thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbwvkp9", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lkbc7/cmv_i_shouldnt_have_views/dbwvkp9/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483413749.0, "author_flair_text": "2\u2206", "created_utc": 1483384949.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lkbc7", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbxgyy9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Iustinianus_I", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5lkbc7", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "It sounds like you are saying \"I shouldn't believe in things dogmatically,\" meaning that you are willing to abandon beliefs if they don't match up with evidence.
