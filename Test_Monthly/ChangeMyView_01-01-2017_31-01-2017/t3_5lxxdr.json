I stated that above when noting how non-violent and well intentioned movements may ultimately elicit negative results. Check my notes regarding socialism above on that matter.\nAdditionally, previous oppression of the jews by various powers throughout history does not justify violence in modern day society. We hold all to an equal standard of civil obedience and previous oppression does not validate uncivil behavior. So yes, it does surprise me that black americans feel justified in acting in such a way when japanese americans and jewish people globally do not act similarly nor do we expect them to. \n\nHistorically black americans have certainly been oppressed by the white majority. However, I do not believe that the disparities experienced today can solely be explained by white oppression. It surprises me that you fail to see other variables that may be playing a large role. Let me provide a few examples to express my point. \n\nAccording to the institute on assets and social policy in america, the median Chinese household income is 57,418 while white americans have a median household income of 48,877. This is quite clearly a difference. Now it would be unwise to suggest that this gap must be proof of discrimination in America given that Asian Americans have historically faced discrimination similar to that of other minority groups. So why is it that there is a difference in median household income between the two ethnicities? In turns out that Chinese Americans frequently major in mathematics and modern sciences such as biochemistry and computer engineering. These majors lead to jobs in higher paying industries ultimately influencing the Chinese American median household income.  \n\nThe following statistics suggest that systematic bias does not in fact plague the police force in america. \n\n1. In Houston it was found that blacks were 24% less likely than whites to be shot by officers.\n2. An analysis of the Washington Post's Police Shooting Database and of Federal Crime Statistics reveals that nearly twelve percent of all whites and hispanics who die of homicide are killed by cops while by contrast only four percent of black homicide victims are killed by cops.\n3. Many will cite the statistic that black americans make up 26 percent of police shootings while only represented as 13 percent of the national population. This is a silly statistic to suggest any bias involved. Police shootings occur more frequently where officers confront armed or violently resisting suspects. Those suspects are unfortunately disproportionately black. \n4. Note the following. Black americans represent approximately 13 percent of the national population yet 62% of all robberies, 57% of murders and 45% of assaults are committed by black americans according to the Department of Justice. Is it possible that your statistic of blacks being 2.5 times more likely to be shot by cops ties back to these very realities? I would argue that this statistic is quite clearly not suggesting racism and rather a representative statistic that corresponds with the proportion of black males committing violent crime.

So yes, it does surprise me that black americans feel justified in acting in such a way when japanese americans and jewish people globally do not act similarly nor do we expect them to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Historically black americans have certainly been oppressed by the white majority. However, I do not believe that the disparities experienced today can solely be explained by white oppression. It surprises me that you fail to see other variables that may be playing a large role. Let me provide a few examples to express my point. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to the institute on assets and social policy in america, the median Chinese household income is 57,418 while white americans have a median household income of 48,877. This is quite clearly a difference. Now it would be unwise to suggest that this gap must be proof of discrimination in America given that Asian Americans have historically faced discrimination similar to that of other minority groups. So why is it that there is a difference in median household income between the two ethnicities? In turns out that Chinese Americans frequently major in mathematics and modern sciences such as biochemistry and computer engineering. These majors lead to jobs in higher paying industries ultimately influencing the Chinese American median household income.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The following statistics suggest that systematic bias does not in fact plague the police force in america. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In Houston it was found that blacks were 24% less likely than whites to be shot by officers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An analysis of the Washington Post&amp;#39;s Police Shooting Database and of Federal Crime Statistics reveals that nearly twelve percent of all whites and hispanics who die of homicide are killed by cops while by contrast only four percent of black homicide victims are killed by cops.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Many will cite the statistic that black americans make up 26 percent of police shootings while only represented as 13 percent of the national population. This is a silly statistic to suggest any bias involved. Police shootings occur more frequently where officers confront armed or violently resisting suspects. Those suspects are unfortunately disproportionately black. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Note the following. Black americans represent approximately 13 percent of the national population yet 62% of all robberies, 57% of murders and 45% of assaults are committed by black americans according to the Department of Justice. Is it possible that your statistic of blacks being 2.5 times more likely to be shot by cops ties back to these very realities? I would argue that this statistic is quite clearly not suggesting racism and rather a representative statistic that corresponds with the proportion of black males committing violent crime. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc09bc1", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lxxdr/cmvwhen_an_ideology_is_continously_cited_as_the/dc09bc1/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483598636.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483569836.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc059gz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cyclopsrex", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc009ns", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "So you have a group that is historically and presently oppressed by the white majority and you are surprised that some of them are angrier than the BLM leadership.
