That&amp;#39;s quite a lot of people. In my opinion it is impossible to properly represent everyone, specially in a bipartisan system. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the case for this election, many people would not vote for Hillary Clinton because of the corruption she and her organization stand for. Some of these people would not vote for Donald Trump either on basis of his lack of political experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this case you have very little options as to vote, as the voting for someone else would be as good as voting for no one. This happens due to our voting system, called Single Non Transferable Vote (I think it&amp;#39;s also called First Pass the Post).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This voting system introduces tactical voting.
