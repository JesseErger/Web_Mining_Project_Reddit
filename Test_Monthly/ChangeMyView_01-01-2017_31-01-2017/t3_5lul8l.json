The relentless march of technology. Over the past few hundred years the productive potential of the human race has exploded. Automation has already seriously reduced human labour in most primary and secondary sectors and automation is only increasing. Service sector jobs are now not only being &amp;#39;threatened&amp;#39; but actually cut down by automation. As technology develops automation threatens more and more complex jobs, even now jobs in &lt;a href=\"http://towcenter.org/research/guide-to-automated-journalism/\"&gt;journalism&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c8ef3f62-ea9c-11e5-888e-2eadd5fbc4a4\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; are considered under serious threat of automation in the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment#The_Luddite_fallacy\"&gt;traditional viewpoint&lt;/a&gt; is that automation may cause unemployment in the short term but in the long run jobs will always be created.

Rather than automating one sector of employment at once as was traditionally the case now computerisation is allowing automation to threaten jobs across the economy all at the same time. Automation is eating more jobs than the economy can create, being &lt;a href=\"http://reports.weforum.org/outlook-global-agenda-2015/top-10-trends-of-2015/2-persistent-jobless-growth/\"&gt;blamed&lt;/a&gt; for the &amp;#39;jobless recovery&amp;#39;s&amp;#39; felt across the world.

The argument here is not that post-scarcity is just around the corner or even on the horizon (though it might be) but that the development technology means that at some point, perhaps even in the far &amp;amp; distant future, post-scarcity will arrive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second point of the argument is that post-scarcity will result in communism. In a post-scarcity society it would become absurd to charge &amp;quot;money&amp;quot; for most things seeing as everything could be produced at negligible cost. The only way for capitalism to exist would be for it to create artificial scarcity which again would be absurd seeing as their would be no motive to do so. In a post-scarcity society their would be no material benefit to preventing others from having freely available goods. If one was to try and create artificial-scarcity in a post-scarcity world then society would surely react with extreme anger. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There would be no reason to own the means of production if there is no way to gain material benefit from them.
