The idea that a person would advocate for an individual without their capitulation towards our own values is a conservative red flag. Liberals hold no pretenses that immigrants are going to share the same values as western society off the boat.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, maybe I&amp;#39;m misunderstanding what you&amp;#39;re saying -- I&amp;#39;m having a bit of trouble decrypting the sentence, to be honest -- but I think you&amp;#39;re saying that there is a discrepancy between the fact that liberals do think anyone (or at least most people) should be able to immigrate to the US and the fact that they also know that they aren&amp;#39;t going to share all of our values.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think there is a big difference between someone sharing all of our values and someone following all of our laws. I think people should be allowed to have any opinion they want on how women and homosexuals should be treated, but they shouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed to treat women and homosexuals however they want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If somone thinks that women should cover up, for example, that&amp;#39;s fine. That&amp;#39;s their opinion. I think they&amp;#39;re wrong, I&amp;#39;ll say that they&amp;#39;re wrong, but they don&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to change your mind on it. However, if someone forces a woman to cover up, that&amp;#39;s definitely not okay. In that case they&amp;#39;re breaking the law and will have to go to court. In practice, there are of course several difficulties that arise from this, but ideally, this is how it should be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think you&amp;#39;re conflating the two ideas of holding different values and acting upon those values. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbzkcyc", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lte2g/cmv_the_idea_that_liberalsfeminists_are_boxed_in/dbzkcyc/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483569489.0, "author_flair_text": "9\u2206", "created_utc": 1483540689.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lte2g", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lte2g", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 4, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lte2g", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lte2g", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lte2g", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lte2g", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lte2g", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lte2g", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lte2g", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lte2g", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_dbyllke", "depth": 10, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbyllke", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Mitoza", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dbylfdx", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "My criticality of the repression of women is a position, not a history of arguments.
