Lots of traditions don't make logical sense, but we do them anyway and that's not a reason to do away with them (that would require an actual logical reason to the contrary). \n\nTipping is kind of a weird thing, but be careful what you ask for... you might get it. \n\nIf we replaced tipping waiters with a 15 or 20% \"service charge\" in a restaurant, what actual advantage have you received? The only change would be that \"tipping\" is now mandatory rather than optional, regardless of what your service was like. \n\nIf you wanted to argue that you got poor service, you'd have to enter into a conflict with the manager rather than just leaving a smaller tip. If you thought that you'd only received a 10% tip worth of service, you'd have to somehow justify *that* specific value to someone to get them to remove it from your bill.\n\nIs that hassle worth it? Or is it better to let the consumers have an expectation that a good tip is due if service was good, and make their own decisions about it? Yes, it's rare that people actually do this, and it's considered a grave step, because you're depriving someone of their livelihood for a service they actually did provide you, just not in a manner that you found most pleasing... but that's probably a good thing. \n\nTips are basically commissions (or, if you prefer, profit sharing). I find \"hidden commissions\" to be far more problematic. When you buy something in a store and the price secretly includes the commission that the saleperson is going to receive, that causes problems. How do you know whether the salesperson is actually trying to do the best for you? You don't. You *know* that they are trying to do the best for their employer (e.g. by selling the highest margin product rather than the best one).", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 109, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lm6m0", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 72, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lm6m0", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"body": "&gt;The reason to the contrary here is that abandoning tipping makes the final price more explicit to the customer, rather than having the customer calculate it themselves.\n\nAlmost every restaurant provides suggested tip amounts today.

It's exactly as explicit in almost all cases. \n\n&gt;this problem can be easily solved by having the customer fill out a really quick rating form at the end\n\nThe problem with this mechanism is that people don't actually do that.

A tip nowadays isn&amp;#39;t so much about expressing gratitude as it is about bribing the chef and wait staff to not spit in your food. The fact that employers count tips toward satisfying the minimum wage is indicative of the fact that tips are expected and not seen as a extra gesture of gratitude.

It&amp;#39;s good for the business as it reduces the highest cost associated with ahcing a business which is paying employees wages and it reduces meal prices making them more competivtive. Finally, it is BEST for the servers.  They make a shit more money on the tipping system than they would on a regular hourly wage.  Work a few hours on a Friday or Saturday night and you are making way more than you ever would if you were making say $15.00 an hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It makes no sense to change, because it is better for all parties involved.  The only people who think otherwise are foreigners who have a different culture.  It&amp;#39;s pretty simple.  When you go to a restaurant you mentally factor in the tip ahead of time.  You aren&amp;#39;t being blind by having to pay an tra couple dollars, cause you already have that mentally factored in.  It&amp;#39;s not a big deal, it&amp;#39;s the way things work and it is way better for everyone.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbwqcet", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lm6m0/cmv_tipping_should_be_done_away_with/dbwqcet/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483407270.0, "author_flair_text": "4\u2206", "created_utc": 1483378470.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lm6m0", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 2, "name": "t1_dbxw6es", "id": "dbxw6es", "parent_id": "t1_dbxsqhc", "depth": 1, "children": ["dbxw6es"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbxsqhc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Peaker", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5lm6m0", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I'm from Israel where tipping is also really expected (virtually mandatory).\n\nI think tipping is a positive thing because of the socialist aspect of it.

First off it is completely voluntary, no one will ever force you to pay a tip. This could be added on to your bill and then the restaurant could pay me a normal wage but I&amp;#39;m here to entertain you as much as deliver your food. If I had no reason to push myself to be the best server and give amazing service you would get a lot more shitty service which is good for no one and that would be the result of restaurants charged more and abolished tipping. If I was going to make only minimum wage I would without a doubt get a job that isn&amp;#39;t as stressful, because why work harder for the same amount of money. I serve because honestly it is good money for the work that I have to do but if I had a flat rate I would have no reason to shoot the shit with you or care about your being. But I&amp;#39;m a great server because I care about my guest and it shows, you get better service with me and because give you good service in the industry I expect 20%, but again you have the choice. At the end of the day as much as we are serving food, we are pg strippers. You come to us to be entertained and to feel good then you tip us.
