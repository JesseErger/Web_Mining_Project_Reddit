That's an international war crime. Most people can agree that killing civilians is different than killing armed militants, because civilians by definition are not trying to harm anyone.\n\n&gt;We've allowed whether a chemical weapon was used to be the basis for whether something was \"bad.\"  Rather, it should be how and to what end the weapon was used, not the type of weapon, that determines judgment of \"war\" or \"murder.\" \n\nChemical weapons are not efficient at doing what you want them to do. Because their efficiency at killing enemy militants is so low, everyone has agreed not to use them.

But it's international headlines and universal condemnation when it's done with gas. Casualties can be the same or worse, it won't matter.\n\nAlthough I agree it's somewhat hypocritical, there is a logical basis.

However, if you do it using chemical weapons, you have caused a war crime as well as broken international treaties that can as well be considered war crimes. \n\n&gt; I do not know the half life of chemical weapons in a battle space, but I would be very surprised if they remained lethal for more than 24 hours. If you can show me data of lethality for 48 hours or more\n\nI will be quoting [the CDC](https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/vx/basics/facts.asp) regarding persistence;\n\nSulfur Mustard (Vesicant):\n\n* If sulfur mustard is released into the air as a vapor, people can be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing. Sulfur mustard vapor can be carried long distances by wind.\nIf sulfur mustard is released into water, people can be exposed by drinking the contaminated water or getting it on their skin.\nPeople can be exposed to liquid sulfur mustard by eating it or getting it on their skin.\nSulfur mustard can last from 1 to 2 days in the environment under average weather conditions and from weeks to months under very cold conditions.\nSulfur mustard breaks down slowly in the body, so repeated exposure may have a cumulative effect (that is, it can build up in the body).\n\nVX (Nerve Agent)\n\n* VX is the most potent of all nerve agents. Compared with the nerve agent sarin (also known as GB), VX is considered to be much more toxic by entry through the skin and somewhat more toxic by inhalation.\nIt is possible that any visible VX liquid contact on the skin, unless washed off immediately, would be lethal.VX is the least volatile of the nerve agents, which means that it is the slowest to evaporate from a liquid into a vapor. Therefore, VX is persistent in the environment. Under average weather conditions, VX can last for days on objects that it has come in contact with. Under very cold conditions, VX can last for months.\nBecause it evaporates so slowly, VX can be a long-term threat as well as a short-term threat. Surfaces contaminated with VX should therefore be considered a long-term hazard.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your first paragraph is a matter of opinion.

If you can show me data of lethality for 48 hours or more&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will be quoting &lt;a href=\"https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/vx/basics/facts.asp\"&gt;the CDC&lt;/a&gt; regarding persistence;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sulfur Mustard (Vesicant):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If sulfur mustard is released into the air as a vapor, people can be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing. Sulfur mustard vapor can be carried long distances by wind.\nIf sulfur mustard is released into water, people can be exposed by drinking the contaminated water or getting it on their skin.\nPeople can be exposed to liquid sulfur mustard by eating it or getting it on their skin.\nSulfur mustard can last from 1 to 2 days in the environment under average weather conditions and from weeks to months under very cold conditions.\nSulfur mustard breaks down slowly in the body, so repeated exposure may have a cumulative effect (that is, it can build up in the body).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VX (Nerve Agent)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;VX is the most potent of all nerve agents. Compared with the nerve agent sarin (also known as GB), VX is considered to be much more toxic by entry through the skin and somewhat more toxic by inhalation.\nIt is possible that any visible VX liquid contact on the skin, unless washed off immediately, would be lethal.VX is the least volatile of the nerve agents, which means that it is the slowest to evaporate from a liquid into a vapor. Therefore, VX is persistent in the environment. Under average weather conditions, VX can last for days on objects that it has come in contact with. Under very cold conditions, VX can last for months.\nBecause it evaporates so slowly, VX can be a long-term threat as well as a short-term threat. Surfaces contaminated with VX should therefore be considered a long-term hazard.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbzdsnq", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5ly5zp/cmv_there_is_no_moral_distinction_between_the/dbzdsnq/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483554522.0, "author_flair_text": "45\u2206", "created_utc": 1483525722.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 7, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5ly5zp", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 6, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5ly5zp", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5ly5zp", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbzdq7s", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DeltaBot", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dbzdpvn", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/HarpyBane ([3\u2206](/r/changemyview/wiki/user/HarpyBane)).\n\n^[Delta\u00a0System\u00a0Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)\n[\u200b](HTTP://DB3PARAMSSTART\n{\n  \"comment\": \"This is hidden text for DB3 to parse.

If you use bombs or missiles on an enemy bunker, even if you miss (or there is collateral damage) you can say you tried your best to only hit the target. If you use chemical weapons, you&amp;#39;re basically signaling to everyone that you don&amp;#39;t care who you kill in that area. Another difference is that not every conventional attack is meant to kill as many people as possible.

There are tools that are effective, which happen to be cruel. There are tools that are cruel that happen to have an effect. You describe some obvious effects of physical weapons, but you ignore the more gruesome effects of chemical weapons. A bomb initiates to provide heat, over-pressure and high energy shrapnel, which kills quickly. The purpose of a bomb is to destroy. The purpose of gases is more to cause suffering. Though, similar weapons can be used to kill personnel without touching infrastructure.\n\nChemical weapons do not kill quickly. Nerve gases obscure the body's ability to release muscles, including the respiratory system, rendering you unable to control anything. Every muscle in your body clenches and you lose control of anything. You shit yourself, you piss yourself, you bite down on your tongue, and then you die of asphyxiation.
