Soccer has 3 make calls, baseball has 3-4 for most games, basketball has 3, hockey has 3. NFL puts out 7. Also, the NFL is and was miles ahead of every other major sports organization in terms of replays, challenges, video review, automatic video review, penalty review, etc. The NFL was the first to implement video review. Now all the big leagues do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;#39;re happy with the calls or feel that it&amp;#39;s enough or what, it seems ludicrous to me that you&amp;#39;re arguing that the NFL doesn&amp;#39;t care when they&amp;#39;re the first to implement everything in the way of helping out the officials.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;technology/rule changes/officiating accountability by the league itself is not a Top Priority over ball inflation and drug policy...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to comment on that. These are two different departments, and their drug policy isn&amp;#39;t really related to their officials. It&amp;#39;s like saying, &amp;quot;The NFL is more interested in scheduling 16 game seasons than it is in designing better jerseys&amp;quot;. I have no idea if they are, or if there&amp;#39;s even a semi-reasonable way to measure how much they care about two different things that they&amp;#39;re doing.
