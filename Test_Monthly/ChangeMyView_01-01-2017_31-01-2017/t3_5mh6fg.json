I'm looking for practical application problems as well as moral/ethical arguments against my view.\n\nThe value I'm trying to uphold is maximizing fairness to everyone involved (including victims, perpetrators, the judge, and the ones promoting the punishment of the criminal). My premise is that upholding eye for an eye minimizes future crimes AND creates the most fair outcome for all involved.\n\nNow here are some small tweaks to the general idea of eye for an eye to make this work in practical applications.\n\n1. This only applies to crimes with intent. If a person causes accidental injury to another party they wouldn't be facing this style of punishment. If a doctor prescribes an experimental medication to a patient that ends up killing them, there was no intent to harm, so the doctor would not face eye for an eye punishment.\n\n2. The punishment applied to the criminal is equal to the ~~worst suffering~~ most harm they inflicted on a single individual in their crime. So if an individual causes injury or suffering to multiple individuals in a public shoot-up injuring 3 and killing 1, they themselves would face death because it's worse than what they inflicted on others. ~~And before you jump in and say, 'how are we to decide which suffering is worse?' that would be~~ the job of judges [would be].

It *may* be plausible to say that in a few generations we may have robots specifically programmed to act out certain categories of punishments for us, but that's not a critical point here. \n\nMy arguments:\n\n1. Less crime as to-be criminals are forced to empathize with their victim(s).\n\n2. Fixes the issues of under-punishment as well as over-punishment in the current system (ie marijuana users getting locked up for 20 years because of some antiquated law)\n\n3. The justice system does not need to make the well-being of the victim its priority, and should only focus on preserving an equilibrium in society. \n\n4. The eye for an eye system doesn't need to fix ALL the issues inherent with any justice system. It just needs to solve them better than the status quo.\n\nI'm really eager to hear what you guys will say.

The only crimes in which intent is not proven are strict liability crimes, and those aren't as common as you seem to be implying. For example, when it comes to homicide, the only form which does not have a mens rea requirement is involuntary manslaughter. However, voluntary manslaughter, second degree murder and first degree murder all have varying forms of intent required to be proven because they all occur with a different state of mind in the defendant. You are suggesting they are instead treated equally despite the various degrees in which voluntary manslaughter is less serious than second degree murder as second degree murder is to first degree murder. \n\nIn any case, this still doesn't address my point that innocent people will undoubtedly be convicted as well in such a system. Any punishment they receive cannot be undone, and many who were wrongly raped, tortured, beaten, and the families of those killed, would want equal vengeance for what was done to them. Remember, you are encouraging a system you claim is supposed to promote an equilibrium. How do you keep it equal if the people who are punishing those who are innocent are presumeably immune to retaliatory justice? You can't. \n\n&gt; You assume that being in prison is better than getting raped or executed (also remember execution is a thing in the current system, and that wrongful execution constitutes about 4.1% of current stats, so no you can't do anything about this either). That's subjective, and it can't be estimated whether getting raped or put in prison for a decade is better or worse for anyone. It depends on the person.\n\nExecutions are becoming outlawed in more states and simply being used less or not at all in many others. Just because it exists though does not mean that I agree with it. I am against executions in the current system as well for the same reasons, so claiming they exist in the current system doesn't really make any argument against what I am saying because I disagree with their existence in the system. \n\nBut you are assuming as well that your punishments are better than imprisonment. There is a key difference between the two though in that imprisonment can be ended early if new evidence shows the convicted person is innocent. You can reasonably expect let a person out of prison 10 years before the end of their 20 year sentence after being found innocent. You cannot say the same about stopping halfway into raping someone who was wrongly convicted of rape.\n\n&gt; In the current system, only about half the states require compensation. This guy only got $75.\n\nPlease note what I said. I said you can compensate someone for their time, not that it is required or that it happens all of the time. The point here is still that you can try to make up for someone's lost time in a reasonable way. Eye for an eye justice just means you need to have the person or people responsible for the innocent person being wrongly convicted and punished themselves be punished in the same way, otherwise you lose all credibility and legitimacy. \n\n&gt; Arguing that this proposed system will increase threats has no meaning. Again, threats don't mean a thing from an objective standpoint.\n\nIt absolutely does. In the current system, you can be punished if you threaten someone. For example, jury tampering is a serious crime in our current system. It acts as a deterrent by its punishement, like all crimes do. Your system would do what to a person who engaged in jury tampering? An eye for an eye, so if you threaten a juror, you will be threatened. Except you can have every intention of following through on your threat to that juror, whereas the state can't really say the same. \n\nThreats are just an example of a larger problem You are actually encouraging all sorts of behavior from people who have little or no fear of facing the same thing they threaten with. For example, let's say you just bought a house for $50,000 and you have a job which pays about $3,000 per month. Now, I, a wealthy man who wants to buy your property, comes to you and offers you $25,000 for it. I tell you that if you do not sell it to me, I will break a window. I will make you this offer every day, and every day that you refuse, a window is broken which will cost you $100 to replace. If I break that window, it will cost me $100 because of my own $100 window which will be broken. I can afford it though, because I am wealthy. After breaking your window every day for a month though, you will have spent every dollar you earned in that month replacing windows, and it will take over a year before it starts to come close to being a net loss for me in buying that home from you compared to what it is worth. It will become a much bigger issue for you long before then because you won't be able to afford to live after buying all of these windows. I can literally extort you out of your home and buy it from you for nearly half the cost of what you paid for it, then sell it to someone else for a profit while you lost $25,000 on it at least and with nothing to show for it. \n\n&gt; I brought up the fact that informal polls show support for it because you emphasized, \"For the millions of people who would disagree\" you seem to be using it as an argument. I was pointing out that it doesn't work as an ethical or practical argument to say that one side of the debate has the backings of many people.\n\nYou said in your original argument that an eye for an eye system would fix the issue of over and under punishment. These are only problems if people believe they are problems. You brought in the concept of what people (whether that is many people or just you) believe to be right or wrong simply by suggesting that criminals can be punished too much or too little since that is entirely a subjective statement. Therefore, to say there are many people who would find an eye for an eye to be too severe is perfectly valid. \n\n&gt; This can't be true, because by favoring peace over all supports the argument that we could theoretically kill anyone who disagrees with us. \n\nThat is not at all what it means. You extend as much punishment as is necessary to create a sense of deterrence while avoiding it creating any kind of blood feud. There is a reason why there is a saying that an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. People are vindictive and vengeful, and the worse the offense is towards them, the more they want to seek vengeance for it. The Hatfield-McCoy is possibly one of the greatest examples of just this. When you take someone's eye, they will want to take one of yours, but you will then want to take their other eye, to which they will want to take your other eye. People aren't noble creatures who just stop and think \"okay, we both lost an eye, now we are even.\" \n\n&gt; The eye for an eye system isn't necessarily focused on vengeance.\n\nThis truly is a noble thought, no sarcasm at all. However, it is also very naive as well. Make no mistake, the idea behind it is all about getting even, and people have different ideas of what it means to get even. Some will settle for less, some will want more, few will suffice in being truly even. \n\n&gt; The theme is more of punishment and equilibrium, so in such a system his death would be the biggest loss he could possibly suffer and would be seen as more fair than if he were just subjected to the things the other three women were put through.\n\nAnd this is where things get very complicated. You think his death would suffice, and perhaps many other people would as well. But there are also many people who would feel that the women who were rapes were the worse victims compared to the woman who was simply killed without suffering. Look at another common belief for abolishing the death penalty in that some people think murderers should have to suffer with the knowledge of their crime and live with it in order to appease the families of the victim. Make no mistake, the person who was murdered is not the only victim of a murder. The person who is was murdered though, their suffering is over. The same can't be said of the family. \n\nGo back to what I said before. \n\n&gt; If you torture and killed my father, would it be more fair for me to be able to torture and kill you or your father?\n\nYou might say it would be more fair for me to torture and kill you, whereas I might say it is more fair for me to do that to your father. When we say \"an eye for an eye,\" it is not actually very specific. Do I take your right or left eye of you took my left one? If my left one was my good eye, does that mean I take your good right eye, or do I still take only your left eye? I'm sure it seems petty, but this is how people will think when you say it's a system about equilibrium. By whatever name you call it, it will be seen as a system of vengeance, and that is how people will want it treated.

Instead, what is more important is to ensure people interact as peaceably as possible in order to avoid as many conflicts as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This can&amp;#39;t be true, because by favoring peace over all supports the argument that we could theoretically kill anyone who disagrees with us. That minimizes conflict with the best possible outcome. If someone wrongs me, I should just incapacitate them totally in order to maintain peace? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, with a system fueled by the idea of vengeance, those three surviving women are probably going to feel he wasn&amp;#39;t punished enough because of what they now have to live with.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The eye for an eye system isn&amp;#39;t necessarily focused on vengeance.

Poaching becomes a no risk system because I don&amp;#39;t own an endangered animal to be taken from me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Less crime as to-be criminals are forced to empathize with their victim(s).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are assuming criminals will empathize with their victims rather than feel anger towards the system and victims themselves. This system does not force empathy, it just encourages criminals to be more aggressive in threatening and punishing their victims further in order to ensure they are never caught. If I am going to burglarize someone&amp;#39;s house, I can either do it and leave so that they can report it, or I can leave behind a message threatening to kill them if they report the burglary to the police. The victims have more to lose by letting anyone know about the burglarly than they do if they say nothing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fixes the issues of under-punishment as well as over-punishment in the current system&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It only fixes under and over punishment if you think that an eye for an eye is a good system. For the millions of people who would disagree, it makes the system even worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The justice system does not need to make the well-being of the victim its priority, and should only focus on preserving an equilibrium in society.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The justice system does not make the wellbeing of the victims a priority anyway. Crimes which occur under the criminal code are considered crimes against the state. The point of punishments as they are is to maintain the peace, which is more important than an equilibrium, especially since your system doesn&amp;#39;t maintain equilibrium. Punishing a person for the worst harm caused to a single person means everyone might not feel the punishment was enough, and the criminal may feel it was too much. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The eye for an eye system doesn&amp;#39;t need to fix ALL the issues inherent with any justice system. It just needs to solve them better than the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t fix it or do any better, it just works differently. You might make some problems less prevalent, but you will also make some more prevalent. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc3nnqn", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5mh6fg/cmv_the_us_justice_system_should_apply_eye_for_an/dc3nnqn/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483780711.0, "author_flair_text": "29\u2206", "created_utc": 1483751911.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mh6fg", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mh6fg", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mh6fg", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc41l3y", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DeltaBot", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc41kv8", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/Grunt08 ([124\u2206](/r/changemyview/wiki/user/Grunt08)).\n\n^[Delta\u00a0System\u00a0Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)\n[\u200b](HTTP://DB3PARAMSSTART\n{\n  \"comment\": \"This is hidden text for DB3 to parse.

Two wrongs are merely two wrongs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose you could contort some utilitarian or consequentialist understandings of morality to argue that the ends justify the means (and has been done in the past).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Is it wrong to force a person to endure what they have inflicted on people?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This depends on what moral code you subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If people are committing crimes because they don&amp;#39;t know what it is like to endure those crimes being committed against them, then wouldn&amp;#39;t educating that person with first hand experience be a good thing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the very least it would deter people who are willing to commit crimes because they feel they can endure the possible prison time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your aim is to somehow punish people into goodness and your moral code (and laws, of course) allow that then that might be something permisable. However: do you evidence that retributive justice is an effective strategy? Said evidence won&amp;#39;t speak to the moral systems involved, but at least we could add some data to the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the very least &amp;quot;two wrongs don&amp;#39;t make a right&amp;quot; is a vague argument. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think so. It&amp;#39;s quite plain and clear. You might be able to argue that the benefits of the second &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; (the retributive punishment) outweighs the outcome of not administering the punishment. But if by definition that other wrong punishment is actually wrong, then it doesn&amp;#39;t make a &amp;quot;right.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Who is to say that imprisonment isn&amp;#39;t wrong, or that stripping rights for life because of a single decision is wrong?
