The first is we need to get clear on what a \"ghost\" might feasibly be, and the second is that we need to get clear on what being \"real\" might feasibly mean.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's start with ghosts. What might a ghost be? There are a ton of different explanations for this, some of them more theological, others more theoretical. \n\n\nOne of the most common definitions for ghosts is that they are the spirits of people who have left this world: souls somehow getting \"stuck\" on the Earthly plane. This doesn't really seem like a great explanation, because there is no real reason to believe in mind-body dualism, and it directly conflicts with a lot of Christian theology. It makes a little more sense if you're fitting it into Catholicism, because you might be able to get away with some tenuous link between purgatory and souls that haven't come to rest, but you're still reaching. So this doesn't really seem like a reasonable option, even if you *are* a mind-body dualist (which you probably shouldn't be).\n\n\nAnother common idea is that ghosts are some kind of sentient energy which we can pick up with EF sensors - perhaps from a different dimension, or from some super-evolutionary timeline that we aren't privy to. This isn't a great definition either, though, because there's no real scientific evidence of this and anything that can be seen as evidence is easily refuted. EF sensors, for example, are very likely to pick up on natural wavering of electrical signals in the environment (faulty wiring, other equipment in the area like cameras, even human bodies getting to close too the sensor). Also, these beings should probably be a lot more prevalent if it were something to do with this - we'd detect them all over, even during the day in places with good lighting, or perhaps outside in nice fields and gardens. It seems odd that they are only detected at night in old, dilapidated buildings or tunnels - there's no good reason for extra-dimensional energy beings to be picky about where they are living.\n\n\nThe final explanation is a more scientific one, which is that ghosts are just a combination of our normal neurological functioning going haywire or being prompted to fire without normal stimulus. This one actually has some promise, because there is some real scientific evidence pointing to the idea that our senses can be affected in such a manner so as to make it seem that an entity is in the room with us. For example, experiments with [infrasound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrasound#Human_reactions) suggest that low frequency sound below the range of human hearing can have effects on our perception, causing \"anxiety, uneasiness, extreme sorrow, nervous feelings of revulsion or fear.\" Similarly, scientists have shown that we can experience [phantom presences](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26516-ever-felt-a-ghostly-presence-now-we-know-why/) just by altering our normal mental states in weird ways. Also, it has been shown that [electromagnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_helmet), the same ones supposedly being searched for with ghost hunting equipment, can cause us to feel uneasy or sense presences in a room. It has been shown that infrasound exists at many \"haunting\" sites, and we already know that EMFs are common in haunting areas (ghost hunters often cite them as evidence of a \"presence\" and find them all the time). These seem like much more reasonable explanations of haunting activity, especially since there is almost 0 real photographic or audio evidence of ghosts - the vast majority of \"evidence\" has been proven to be doctored or ersatz.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, we've figured out what ghosts might feasibly be: weird neurological states caused by natural phenomenon. Now we have to decide if ghosts are real or not. In one sense, yes, they absolutely are real. Things like infrasound and electromagnetic fields are real, after all, and so is our experience of them (they really *do* create weird feelings and anxiety). So in that sense ghosts are real, because they are experienced by us, and the natural phenomenon causing ghostly feelings are real as well.\n\n\nIn another sense, though, they aren't real, because our senses are not determining what's really going on. Our experience is telling us that there is a presence in the room or that something really scary is happening, when in reality all we're picking up on is low frequency sound waves and electromagnetic fields. Why those things cause a fear response in us is still an open question, but to say that ghosts are \"real\" is a bit of a stretch - the feelings are real, but they don't map one-to-one with the causes of those feelings.", "edited": 1483466963.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to get clear on two things, here.

School is single storye, high ceiling, has net curtains, it's a sunny day, I have my back to the window. I suddenly feel very distant from the room, my field of vision shrinks (I can see my hands clearly, but anything further is watery and blurry), and although I can still hear everything sounds very garbled and somehow louder yet more far away. Then I feel a presence behind me, I turn and am dazzled by the bright light from outside through the curtains. I see a white, ghostly figure - I can only see its clothing, there are no hands or head, but it still *feels* like a person. It wears a dated looking suit. I wasn't scared, but I didn't feel any particular benevolence either. It was not 'to scale' with the rest of the background, it seemed more like 'a vision' than something in the room. It walks through me, and I turn around expecting it to come through the other side, but it doesn't. After a few seconds, the room comes back into focus (I remember my hearing sound like a tape being speeded up as I could suddenly hear properly again). I felt blessed for the experience at the time, but didn't really believe I'd seen a ghost at the time, or since. \n\nThe problem with it is, if I was a little more credulous, I would be fully convinced I *had seen a real ghost*. This is what most people claim, and then sceptics oppose them by taking their assertions at face value. Sceptics tend to assume that our conscious experience is an accurate reflection of the outside world, but we already have good evidence that it's an illusion. The way I see it, there are two separate things at play here:\n\nLiteral ghosts: These don't exist, obviously. \n\nApparitional experiences: Their existence is harder to falsify, but can't be negated using logic alone. We can't reason what the brain is and isn't capable of, because we *just don't know*! \n\nWho the fuck knows why these things happen, but they do because I've had one and I highly doubt I'm the first. It is my dearly held belief that there is /something/, neurological in basis, that delivers to your conscious the wholly convincing experience of *seeing a ghost* (but obviously you're not seeing a literal ghost), or the convincing memory of having seen a ghost.

School is single storye, high ceiling, has net curtains, it&amp;#39;s a sunny day, I have my back to the window. I suddenly feel very distant from the room, my field of vision shrinks (I can see my hands clearly, but anything further is watery and blurry), and although I can still hear everything sounds very garbled and somehow louder yet more far away. Then I feel a presence behind me, I turn and am dazzled by the bright light from outside through the curtains. I see a white, ghostly figure - I can only see its clothing, there are no hands or head, but it still &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like a person. It wears a dated looking suit. I wasn&amp;#39;t scared, but I didn&amp;#39;t feel any particular benevolence either. It was not &amp;#39;to scale&amp;#39; with the rest of the background, it seemed more like &amp;#39;a vision&amp;#39; than something in the room. It walks through me, and I turn around expecting it to come through the other side, but it doesn&amp;#39;t. After a few seconds, the room comes back into focus (I remember my hearing sound like a tape being speeded up as I could suddenly hear properly again). I felt blessed for the experience at the time, but didn&amp;#39;t really believe I&amp;#39;d seen a ghost at the time, or since. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with it is, if I was a little more credulous, I would be fully convinced I &lt;em&gt;had seen a real ghost&lt;/em&gt;. This is what most people claim, and then sceptics oppose them by taking their assertions at face value. Sceptics tend to assume that our conscious experience is an accurate reflection of the outside world, but we already have good evidence that it&amp;#39;s an illusion. The way I see it, there are two separate things at play here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Literal ghosts: These don&amp;#39;t exist, obviously. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparitional experiences: Their existence is harder to falsify, but can&amp;#39;t be negated using logic alone. We can&amp;#39;t reason what the brain is and isn&amp;#39;t capable of, because we &lt;em&gt;just don&amp;#39;t know&lt;/em&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who the fuck knows why these things happen, but they do because I&amp;#39;ve had one and I highly doubt I&amp;#39;m the first. It is my dearly held belief that there is /something/, neurological in basis, that delivers to your conscious the wholly convincing experience of &lt;em&gt;seeing a ghost&lt;/em&gt; (but obviously you&amp;#39;re not seeing a literal ghost), or the convincing memory of having seen a ghost.
