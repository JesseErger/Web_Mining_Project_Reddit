Because due to the new label of &amp;quot;gender dysphoria&amp;quot; and the removal of the term GID from most mental disorder manuals, many insurance companies will no longer pay for medical procedures related to gender dysphoria, as it is no longer classified as a mental disorder, but rather a cosmetic procedure.

A few reasons. 1) the social stigma against mental disorders, which can cause stress and depression in transgender individuals, 2) transgender persons&amp;#39; adamant refusal of their condition being a mental disorder, and 3) the fact that much of the stress transgender individuals feel stems from their environment rather than from the condition itself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In reference to number 3, it is impossible to determine if ALL transgender individuals experience stress purely based on social stigma, especially considering how gender dysphoria is defined by many transgender people: strong and persistent discomfort with one&amp;#39;s biological sex.

But let me backtrack a bit. My problem with these sorts of things is that what we are trying to do is apply a specific discrete *label* to something; it's almost entirely about the constructed word and classification system we use, not about the nature of the condition itself. So let's start there.\n\nWhat exactly is going on with these individuals? Well, to start, let's talk about biological sex and gender identity. To do that we need to start with the fact that we are human beings, evolved from apes and other beings prior to that, and we are subject to the laws of nature, natural selection, and math.\n\nIn that context, natural selection works on reproductive success of genes, and natural selection has resulted in a few different means of reproduction. For process, there are only two: asexual and sexual reproduction. [Asexual reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexual_reproduction) is typical for simpler organisms but *can* occur in higher organisms such as via parthenogenesis and has been observed in hammerhead and blacktip sharks. This process produces a clone of the parent. (Animals that do this tend to be capable of both asexual and sexual reproduction, and it is only the female that can reproduce asexually and produce clones.)\n\nHumans reproduce sexually. (I am not aware of any cases that have reproduced asexually or if that's even physiological possible.) Sexual reproduction is a binary reproducing process. That is, it occurs by the combination of two gametes. In humans, that's sperm and ovum. So the process itself is binary.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting. In principle, it's possible for both gametes to come from the same organism, referred to as self-fertilization or [autogamy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction#Autogamy). While humans do have a variety of biologically intersexual outcomes for male and female body parts, I don't believe any human has ever reproduced via autogamy/self-fertilization, and it appears that [generally isn't possible](http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2843/can-hermaphrodites-get-themselves-pregnant) given that intersex outcomes range from one of the binary sexes to the other, but never with two complete sets of parts. We'll get to the intersex individuals in a minute.\n\nIt appears that all human beings that ever existed have come from two different parent organisms producing two different gametes: a sperm and an ovum (egg). The sperm-producer is what we call a male and the ovum-producer is what we call a female.\n\nNext, genes. Male sperm-producers result from a combination of an X chromosome from the ovum and Y chromosome in a sperm. Female ovum-producers result from the combination of an X chromosome from the sperm and X from the ovum.\n\nHere's where we get some interesting outcomes. It's possible to have somebody who has female *appearing* features -- that is, features that look like typical XX ovum-producing organisms -- but have XY chromosomes like a typical sperm-producing organism, as in [Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS)](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001180.htm), or the reverse such as [XX Male Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XX_male_syndrome). There are other outcomes that sometimes include three chromosomes (e.g., XXY), but the list of chromosomal and development possibility [gets large](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome#MAIS). Some are infertile, some can reproduce, but those reproductions always go back to the binary gametes. It's the sex chromosomes and biological appearance that vary between the two binary cases on somewhat of a multidimensional continuum, with dimensions depending on *which* traits we're talking about.\n\nWhile these are all possible, by far the most common is either one of the two binary conditions of male (sperm-producer) or female (ovum-producer), and all other conditions on that continuum are rare.\n\nThen we get to brain development and resulting psychological states. These states include instinctive behaviours, including their own personal interests, other individuals in their society the organism identifies as being similar to and which other individuals in their society they are sexually attracted to.\n\nTypically the same genes (XX or XY) that produce the biological features also produce brain structures and hormonal responses that correspond to their chromosomal and biological conditions. That is, an organism with XX and appears biologically female will have a brain structure that internally they identify as feeling like their body is \"correct\", that they identify as being similar as other XX/females and use them as reference points, and are sexually attracted to the biologically appearing males. (It is the outward appearance that matters as far as attraction since one organism can't innately know what the chromosomes, internal identity, or sexual orientation of the other organism is without communication of that information.)\n\nThat is to say, statistically speaking, most people have all 4 factors aligned into one of two binary categories: (XX, biologically female traits, psychologically identify female, sexually attracted to biological males) and (XY, biologically male traits, psychologically identify male, sexually attracted to biological females).\n\nThat gives 4 dimensions. The chromosomes have only a few discrete cases (XX, XY, XXX, XXY, XYY), but the others may generally have a continuum between the two standard binary conditions.\n\nSo now to your question. The mathematics, reproduction, and genetic process that produces binary sexual reproduction is well understood, and its relationship to binary biological and psychological traits is well-understood from a purely \"design\", \"intent\" and reproductive success context. Those are easy to describe as the basis of how nature works.\n\nAnything that falls off of those boundaries is statistically rare and could, in some sense, be considered an \"anomaly\" or \"abnormality\". Statistically speaking, \"normal\" is a statistical claim about big a percentage the cases in that category fall into, and statistical rarities are, by definition, \"abnormal\". Of course, in layman usage these come along with connotations due to the fact that we also have a built-in psychological trait of social norming where we desire to be one of the \"tribe\" and stress and not being perceived that way. (In evolutionary terms, not being part of the tribe generally got you killed, either by that tribe or, being outcast, by another tribe.) The last statistics I could fine suggests 99.7% of all people match the binary categories with chromosomes, physical traits, and psychological identity, and sexual orientation appears to be [96.6% straight](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/07/15/what-percentage-of-the-u-s-population-is-gay-lesbian-or-bisexual/?utm_term=.ad7d7592545d).\n\nA statistical anomaly (\"abnormal\") *could* be described as a disorder if the cause for it is understood in the context of understanding the binary set as effectively a software program for reproductive success following the way natural selection works, essentially a failure of \"quality control\". But again, these terms all have negative connotations of \"broken\" or \"rejected\", despite the fact that such people typically function as individuals just fine on their own terms. A similar problem is people with no libido, i.e., not interested in sex. Clearly this is not a trait that natural selection can select for and can't reproduce sustainably genetically, so isn't in the \"design\" of people. But that doesn't mean there is anything particularly wrong. Even in human terms, manufacturing rejects (out of tolerance, don't conform to design) can still be functional, useful, unique, and even cherished.\n\nSo is the mismatch of biological traits with psychological identity a \"disorder\"? The only reasonable answer depends on pragmatic terms. There can't be an objective answer because the label itself is a creation for a purpose. If you use it to say someone is inferior in some way, then it isn't a disorder. If you use it to say they aren't fine with themselves and need something changed to feel better, then it *is* a disorder. If you want it defined based on insurance companies paying, then it is *better* to define as a disorder. Anybody that claims they have the *right* answer is wrong. Reality doesn't define what a disorder is or isn't; we do, and we can vary it. I see no problem with calling it a disorder for pragmatic reasons, and I tend to view with respect to both statistics and designs, so I think of it in terms of being \"off spec\" and a \"statistical outlier\", but that does not mean any less valuable to me. To others, it might.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmm, well you seem to be approaching it from a pragmatic point of view, which is interesting. But let me backtrack a bit. My problem with these sorts of things is that what we are trying to do is apply a specific discrete &lt;em&gt;label&lt;/em&gt; to something; it&amp;#39;s almost entirely about the constructed word and classification system we use, not about the nature of the condition itself. So let&amp;#39;s start there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What exactly is going on with these individuals? Well, to start, let&amp;#39;s talk about biological sex and gender identity. To do that we need to start with the fact that we are human beings, evolved from apes and other beings prior to that, and we are subject to the laws of nature, natural selection, and math.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that context, natural selection works on reproductive success of genes, and natural selection has resulted in a few different means of reproduction. For process, there are only two: asexual and sexual reproduction. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexual_reproduction\"&gt;Asexual reproduction&lt;/a&gt; is typical for simpler organisms but &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; occur in higher organisms such as via parthenogenesis and has been observed in hammerhead and blacktip sharks. This process produces a clone of the parent. (Animals that do this tend to be capable of both asexual and sexual reproduction, and it is only the female that can reproduce asexually and produce clones.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Humans reproduce sexually. (I am not aware of any cases that have reproduced asexually or if that&amp;#39;s even physiological possible.) Sexual reproduction is a binary reproducing process. That is, it occurs by the combination of two gametes. In humans, that&amp;#39;s sperm and ovum. So the process itself is binary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s where it gets interesting. In principle, it&amp;#39;s possible for both gametes to come from the same organism, referred to as self-fertilization or &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction#Autogamy\"&gt;autogamy&lt;/a&gt;. While humans do have a variety of biologically intersexual outcomes for male and female body parts, I don&amp;#39;t believe any human has ever reproduced via autogamy/self-fertilization, and it appears that &lt;a href=\"http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2843/can-hermaphrodites-get-themselves-pregnant\"&gt;generally isn&amp;#39;t possible&lt;/a&gt; given that intersex outcomes range from one of the binary sexes to the other, but never with two complete sets of parts.

Male sperm-producers result from a combination of an X chromosome from the ovum and Y chromosome in a sperm. Female ovum-producers result from the combination of an X chromosome from the sperm and X from the ovum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s where we get some interesting outcomes.

But they should still get transition care to prevent dysphoria from arising again, just as a person who has recovered from depression may need to stay on antidepressants their whole life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc78dsl", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5my4j3/cmv_gender_dysphoria_may_be_a_mental_disorder_and/dc78dsl/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1484006248.0, "author_flair_text": "37\u2206", "created_utc": 1483977448.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5my4j3", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 5, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5my4j3", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5my4j3", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5my4j3", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc7xltp", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "OFGhost", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc7xfkx", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I see it as the opposite of negation.

She seeks help and is diagnosed with Entomophobia. Having been identified with a phobia, the professional prescribes her with fitting treatments for phobias. She has a disorder. \n\nBob is afraid of insects. He's cool with it though--insects rarely bother him and if they do, he can use a broom or spray to kill them from afar. He doesn't pursue a diagnosis, or treatment. He does not have a disorder as far as professionals are concerned. \n\nCarol is afraid of insects. Her father, being her legal guardian, believes that this is maladaptive and that she should seek help. The is diagnosed with Entomophobia is prescribed with a fitting treatment. She has a disorder. \n\nDave is afraid of insects. Though he is perfectly fine with it, he eventually kills an sapient insect person--Eve. Because Eve somehow has the same rights as a human, the state arrests him for murder. His lawyer sends him to a professional who diagnoses him with Entomophobia. The lawyer uses this diagnosis to argue that Dave is innocent by reason of insanity. This somehow works, even though I don't know many murders that would get off due to a phobia-based insanity plea. Dave avoids jail, but is compelled by the state to seek treatment. Dave has a disorder. \n\nFrank is afraid of insects. It makes sense though--the ongoing war with the insect people takes its toll on everyone. He seeks help and a professional diagnoses him with PTSD. He gets treatment. Frank has a disorder. \n\nHis friend Gwen does not seek treatment, living cooperatively under the new insectoid colonial system. She does not have a disorder. \n\nAnother friend, Harold, lashes out against the oppressors when he assaults a insect police officer. His insect lawyer tries to gets him diagnosed with Entomophobia, but cannot find a professional willing to diagnose as such. Entomophobia is no longer considered a proper diagnosis. Instead it is considered a part of xenophobia--a social ill experienced by everyone. Xenophobes are not ill, they are racist and criminal. The government uses this belief as an excuse and declares Harold guilty in an expedited trial. He does not have a disorder--he's \"just a racist.\" \n\nIn the old records of the insect government. Isaac researches Harold, his great-grandfather. He finds that Harold's lawyer claimed Entomophobia in an insanity plea. This strikes him as just another sign of old insect tyranny. The insects labeled their opposition as insane! It isn't insane to hate the insects for the injustices committed back then. He looks back further and sees more references to Entomophobia throughout the ages. What a dystopian world this used to be! He is thankful to live in a progressive age where insects and humans can live in harmony. Isaac doesn't have a Entomophobia as a disorder, because he's not afraid of insect people. He has a few insects as friends. He has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria though. Gender dysphoria makes him feel uncomfortable with his body, and he is seeking therapy. That's a \"real\" disorder--not like this oppressive \"Entomophobia\" trash. \n\nJessica is afraid of wasps, bees, mosquitoes, etc. She is adamant in saying she is not afraid of insect people. She seeks professional help, but the professional does not diagnose her with Entomophobia. Instead he diagnoses her with Chitinophobia, a fear of chitinous invertebrates. Entomophobia is no longer used--it has too much historical baggage and political subtexts. Instead a new diagnosis is used. This new diagnosis has less social stigma attached and is less likely to be thrown about by laypersons as an insult. Of course, eventually unscrupulous people will pick up the terminology and use it to hurt people. If there's still people suffering from this phobia then and assholes who take advantage of it to hurt them, they will change the term again. \n\nGender dysphoria was a disorder before, because society called it one. Many people today still consider it as one. However, as perceptions shift, so does the diagnosis. In my story above, fear of insects was revolutionized by the inclusion of insect people into society. Entomophobia became synonymous with deviant behavior--something rarely attributed to a disorder, but frequently criminalized. As time progressed, entomophobia was less associated with crime and more with social unrest. It became seen as a symptom of a real problem. Eventually, \"real\" Entomophobia was beat out by the public perception, so the phrase was dropped. The same thing happened to the words \"idiot,\" \"moron,\" \"retard,\" and \"stupid.\" Everytime society abused the diagnosis to insult and criminalize people, the diagnosis changed. \n\nGender dysphoria has and will continue to change too. Not all who fit the symptoms have a disorder, and I think the disorder has become too abused to continue as a serious diagnosis. Imagine if society threw people with cancer into a reeducation camps--there would be a lot less cancer diagnoses even if suffering and treatment continue. \n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a layperson, but I did at least take an intro psych class.
