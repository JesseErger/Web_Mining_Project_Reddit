Character: Roadhog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Roadhog fires a hook that travels a maximum of 20 meters, and if it hits any enemies it &amp;#39;hooks&amp;#39; them and pulls them to Roadhog. Do to some seemingly strange interactions of the hook many users are claiming it to be downright broken and not working correctly. I would argue this is largely incorrect, for anyone who knows how roadhog&amp;#39;s hook works his hook is pretty much always working as designed, it just that do to the limitations of the game engine and game design that some of those interactions can outwardly seem strange at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How does Roadhog&amp;#39;s hook work?:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Roadhog fires a projectile (hook) in a straight path. This projectile has a set velocity and a hitbox, it will travel a maximum of 20 meters from where it was fired. If the hitbox hits an enemy, the hook&amp;#39;s visual will move to the center of the enemy&amp;#39;s character model. The enemy upon being hit will be instantly stunned but temporarily maintain any existing momentum; so if a person is jumping to the right and the hook catches them mid jump, they will be stunned but continue falling to the right. A fraction of a second after the hook catches the enemy, the hook will then proceed to pull the target in to about one or two meters in front of where roadhog is currently standing (forcefully turning the enemy to face the direction of roadhog).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes there will be a wall in front of the enemy when they get pulled in; reasons why this occurs: A) the enemy was standing only partly out of cover, and the hook hit their side (and the hook always pulls from the center). B) the enemy was moving or falling while getting hooked, and while being initially hooked+stunned momentum moved them behind a wall. C) Roadhog was moving/falling when hooking the enemy, potentially causing an obstacle to move inbetween the path of roadhog and the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;when a wall is in inbetween a hooked target and roadhog, the hook will attempt to pull the enemy around the wall. This can look strange because the chain is constantly straight and sometimes clipping through walls, and can sometimes have weird interactions of the hook trying to pull the enemy around said obstacle. The important thing to remember here is that, tho the chain is implied, it is not actually real, it is a fictional visual graphic that has no physics nor collision zone, making it incapable of interacting with anything. In the real world if a chain hooked you as you moved behind a wall and started pulling you in, the chain would bend around that wall and would pull you out from behind that wall. The reason the hook chain does not do this in Overwatch is because giving the chain physics and collision zones would vastly increase the necessary processing power of the game, which would not be practical for what it accomplishes. So the game design compromises, it gives a straight nonphysical chain for us to treat as an actual chain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This I think is the main point of issue for most people, they look at the visuals of the chain as a literal physical object rather than a non-physical representation of an object; It doesn&amp;#39;t always look right, and it doesn&amp;#39;t always have perfect interactions because the game isn&amp;#39;t able to know how the chain would &amp;#39;bend&amp;#39; around walls to pull them back out, but this is a necessary compromise, as rendering physics and collisions for the entire chain is not practical for the purposes of the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So tho hooks might &amp;#39;appear&amp;#39; broken, they are almost always actually exactly as mechanically designed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some might propose that &amp;#39;hooks shouldn&amp;#39;t pull people around walls&amp;#39; to more closely match the (simplified/fictionalized) chain visuals; the problem with that is it in designwise it would likely mean most any ledge or edge of a wall would stop a hooked target from being pulled in; simple upper ledges, doorframes, small terrain objects or even simply standing half behind a wall would make it impossible for hooked targets to be pulled in, making the hook not only near useless but far less consistent in interactions and visuals (what looks worse, a person being pulled from behind a wall, or a person being stopped by their foot catching a 6 inch ledge). These were real issues that have occurred with previous iterations of the hook.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is actually broken with the hook: some targets such as the character Ana get pulled in at incorrect distances compared to every other character, often too far away to even melee without roadhog moving in closer. Also, some enemies get pulled into strange inconsistent locations such as above roadhog (this might fall under the &amp;#39;mechanically correct but flawed&amp;#39; category, is it could be an issue of roadhog simply moving while hooking)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is &amp;#39;mechanically correct&amp;#39; but could still be improved? Sometime when roadhog hooks a target who has abilities to dramatically move their hitbox (Sombra&amp;#39;s teleport, possibly Tracer&amp;#39;s blink, on very rare occasion D.Va&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;call mech&amp;#39; [which moves her hitbox to the mech falling from the sky]), it can cause weird hook interactions such as roadhog landing a hook on sombra right as she is teleporting, then pulling her in from the opposite side of the map. This issue is compounded by lag on both players&amp;#39; sides, causing roadhog&amp;#39;s hook to land on his screen while sombra successfully teleported on her screen (this issue of hit recognition is a complex design problem that has zero perfect answer, there will always be flaws no matter how it is configured).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If people want to argue Roadhog&amp;#39;s hook is overpowered, not fun, or simply doesn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; fair, those are entirely valid opinions, but most claims that his hook is actually &amp;quot;broken&amp;quot; are largely unfounded and simply a result of people not understanding how the hook works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Roadhog&amp;#39;s hooks has flaws, and could debateably be called overpowered or unfun, but mechanically it almost always is working properly and as intended; most people who complain about the hook being broken don&amp;#39;t fully recognize the mechanics of the hook.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things that could change my mind: proving that Roadhog&amp;#39;s hook entirely does not work as designed on a regular basis, or B: providing &lt;em&gt;reasonable&lt;/em&gt; fixes to flaws of perception with his hook interactions that would improve the game feel for both the hooked and the hooker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello, users of CMV!

If the goal is to get hooked characters in front of you, then that is what should happen every time, barring things like a wall blocking the path. But if you were to hook a lucio as he ran past you, you wouldn&amp;#39;t pull him right in front of you every time. Momentum affects where they end up after being hooked which makes it inconsistent. I&amp;#39;d also say that the fact the the distance the character you hook is so inconsistent from where you are is a sign that his hook is broken. &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlW8SDG4DCY\"&gt;This video shows what I&amp;#39;m talking about&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbxzggw", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lrqkb/cmv_roadhogs_hook_is_not_broken/dbxzggw/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483481717.0, "author_flair_text": "1\u2206", "created_utc": 1483452917.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lrqkb", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 2, "name": "t1_dc0na9x", "id": "dc0na9x", "parent_id": "t1_dbymgl1", "depth": 1, "children": ["dc0na9x"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbymgl1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "digikun", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5lrqkb", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "The issue here is that although it looks like a projectile, it's actually a delayed hitscan.
