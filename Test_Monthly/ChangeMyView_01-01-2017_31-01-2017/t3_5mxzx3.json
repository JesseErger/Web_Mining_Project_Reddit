Because it was a mixed bag if we are going to be honest, and speculation on what a world without that history is a useless exercise in general. But when it comes to human rights, that has been one of the bright points in conceptual thought on how to shape society.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how you are wanting to look at or define human rights, but I think the most basic definition works best. &amp;quot;a right that is believed to belong justifiably to every person.&amp;quot; If you are born with it and can do it or need it to survive in your environment its your right. To me thats not a moral framework, its a practical one that goes hand in hand with the concept of the social contract. We give up some rights to live in a system with others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I give up my rights to kill people without justification so that they give up their rights to kill me without justification. I give up my right to rape pillage and loot so it doesn&amp;#39;t happen to me. We all tend to golden rule it, and agree that its best for a society not to have these things happen. Now some people enshrine some rights, and forget about the flipside of the concept wanting to make it a moral issue, and to me that&amp;#39;s missing the practical points of human rights argument.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically ignore pointless moralizing and remember the rights you give up to be a part of the society vs the ones you want to ensure you and other people get.

It's not unique to rights, and I don't think there's anything unique about rights that make them more or less harmful than other ways to talk about moral duties. If being happy is a good thing, don't you have an obligation to help other people being happy? This obligation can be outweighed by other considerations, of course (if it would cost you a lot to make someone else happy, you probably don't have to; but if you can donate a penny to save someone else's life, you're probably obligated to), but it's still something to consider in all cases.

And to give an example that relates directly to other cultures, I believe that laws punishing homosexuality with the death penalty in Africa or laws in Arabic countries forbidding women from doing very basic things are wrong, and that we have obligations to try to fix these situations, regardless of whether or not those cultures agree with us.

Societies with their own definitions of human rights have had conflicts with one another over them for years, and these struggles form the scaffolding of a great deal of class antagonisms, despite their ultimate genesis in socio-economic hierarchies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thought:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even if I was certain I had found the correct set of human rights, I&amp;#39;d still feel uncomfortable with them as a concept; I wouldn&amp;#39;t agree with sending time travelers back to the past to ensure that no person at any point in history ever violated them, because the amount of suffering said time travelers would cause would be immeasurably great.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from the countless issues I have with the prospect with meddling in the past like this, I&amp;#39;d like to think that, as a matter of practice, if you have to cause &amp;quot;immeasurable suffering&amp;quot; in order to implement a set of ethics, then it&amp;#39;s probably not a very good set of ethics.  (Unless of course said suffering is that of the oppressors in a system that perpetrated the very same immeasurable suffering, in which case, by all means, they had it coming.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as my own additions to this discussion, everything I type seems to become rather self-contradictory, so I&amp;#39;m still trying to work this all out in my head, but here are a few marginally sound (as far as I can tell) points I developed:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Modern ethics and the Human Rights we derive from them tend to be based in much more objective reasoning than the &amp;quot;burdens&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;missions&amp;quot; of the past.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Human interconnectivity has grown exponentially, such that awareness of atrocities around us tend to obligate us to act in some way.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, while it may have its flaws in some of its content, implementation, and self-indulgence, the UN&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/\"&gt;Universal Declaration on Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; goes a long way in helping to clarify and ensure agreement on the Human Rights that everybody &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; has.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc85x9k", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5mxzx3/cmv_human_rights_are_a_dangerous_concept_that/dc85x9k/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1484046139.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1484017339.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mxzx3", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc7u00l", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "pigasus26", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5mxzx3", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "You've actually identified a universal moral system of respecting the human condition to live as they choose, from which I think it's fair to say fundamental rights do derive.
