Their time bonding with their team in a locker room has no impact on their ability to play the sport with their male teammates and opponents. It's especially a poor excuse when you consider that the team bonding can just as well take place somewhere else during pre-game, leaving the only time female players are left out as those in which changing rooms are necessary. \n\n&gt; My second reason is that it is very uncomfortable for boys to tackle, bodycheck, etc... girls, due to being raised not to hit girls in any circumstance. When the boys do play physically against girls, it is rarely ever as hard, which gives the girls an unfair advantage.\n\nThe problem here isn't that what you are taught is causing you to go easy on women. The problem is what you were taught. Women can be just as violent and abusive as men. Disregarding that though, being taught not to hit women is not an excuse for not treating them as the equal they want to be seen as in a sport. If they are actually capable of playing on the same level as males within the sport, then it is reasonable to assume they can take a hit or give one out as much as the average player. \n\nIf you mean of a sport in which weight classes aren't taken into consideration at all, I can see why a 200 lb male might be hesitant to tackle a 100 lb female player. This isn't because she is female though, it is because he is twice her weight. The same should also apply to a 100 lb male. However, baring such circumstances, in anything where weight class isn't considered a primary placement method for a player, all players on the field of play should be treated equally. In those where weight class is such, all players within the same weight class should be treated equally. \n\nAs anecdotal evidence, sometimes weight class won't always mean as much either, even in sports where it is used. I used to practice Judo, and while the sport uses weight classes, I can say from personal experience that people who weighed quite a bit less than me were able to throw me down as well as those who weighed more. My instructor was probably about 110 lbs and a bit more than 5 feet tall, half my weight at the time and a foot shorter, yet he could throw me like a ragdoll. There were also women in the class occasionally who could spar on even ground with me despite me having a weight, height, and strength advantage just because of good technique. \n\nNow, I'm not saying this anecdote applies a blanket standard to all contact sports. Far from it actually, as some sports such as football (and hockey as well I imagine) will always give an advantage to those who are physically more dominating. Contact sports don't just include those though, they include numerous sports in which technique can make up for a lack of physical advantage.

Athletic competitions are one of the few areas where the rules are strictly defined and immediately enforceable.  When boys play physically against girls they are treating them as equals.  If a girl is unable to handle that type of physicality they can play for one that suits them better - whether that be a lower league or a girl&amp;#39;s league.  I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s within the spirit of sports to NOT allow someone to test themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbwaibs", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lilix/cmv_girls_should_not_be_allowed_to_join_boys/dbwaibs/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483370046.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483341246.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lilix", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 10, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lilix", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lilix", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 6, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lilix", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbw0fqk", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Memeanator_9000", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dbw09m2", "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I posted because a lot of leagues do allow this and I've never been able to understand, so I wanted to hear other people's opinion on it.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted because a lot of leagues do allow this and I&amp;#39;ve never been able to understand, so I wanted to hear other people&amp;#39;s opinion on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbw0fqk", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lilix/cmv_girls_should_not_be_allowed_to_join_boys/dbw0fqk/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483352851.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483324051.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbw09m2", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dbvzvqu", "score": -2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbw09m2", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lilix/cmv_girls_should_not_be_allowed_to_join_boys/dbw09m2/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483352599.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483323799.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbvzvqu", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Memeanator_9000", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dbvzpac", "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "What do you mean, I just want to see the other side of things and have my view challenged.
