Affirmative action actually ensures that all qualified people, regardless of their race, get the same opportunities. You are not being discriminated against, the opportunities are being evened out. Is it harder to find a job? It's only harder in the same way as if the population went up, except in this case the people are there all the time but don't count unless you take 'action'. Without affirmative action, societal biases ensure that every single time minorities do not get fair representation based on their skills (as others described, universities tend toward 0% black people) - THAT is wrong. If you think this unfairly affects you because other people are being given a fair deal and you are not because you think there is severe discrimination against your ethnicity, then maybe you also need affirmative action. Last time I checked though, Asian Americans didn't face a lot of discrimination/bias (in fact the stereotype implies intelligence generally).

You are not competing against unqualified or incomparable applicants. Federal regulations explicitly prohibit affirmative action programs in which unqualified or unneeded employees are hired. Let me say that again, *federal regulations explicitly prohibit affirmative action programs in which unqualified or unneeded employees are hired*. As an Asian-American, a minority, affirmative action would help you. Asian Americans make-up a [disproportionate amount of the workforce in Silicon Valley](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/ceos-making-youngest-asian-americans-tech-n516691), 41% of Facebook staff, and 31% of Google. By comparison, [blacks and hispanics make up only 4-5% of the tech workforce](http://tech.co/blacks-latinos-5-percent-of-tech-workforce-2015-09). Blacks/hispanics are not taking any jobs away from Whites, Asians, or any other groups because of affirmative action. A color blind hiring process actually works against you because employers are going to be biased in selecting candidates who are like them. Seeing as Whites hold the majority of senior level positions and make the hiring decisions, they would be a disproportionate number of unqualified white people may get positions ahead of Asians, Hispanics, and Blacks. Furthermore, color blind admission and hiring processes will always favor those who grew up with advantages (outside of their control): better funded schools, safe neighborhoods, drug-free community, tutors, access to computers and school supplies, food security, no systemic oppression, etc and it will inherently discriminate against lower income candidates.\n\nAs it relates to college admissions at highly selective universities: Everyone who applies has great test scores, outstanding extracurriculars, and marvelous recommendations. So how does an admissions committee select the incoming class? They choose to build a tapestry of QUALIFIED incoming students from a DIVERSITY backgrounds. Meaning they\u2019re not going to admit an overwhelming majority of students from any particular region, high school, socio-economic, or ethnic background because the incoming class would be an uninteresting, homogenous, echo chamber filled with the same views and experiences. No one is going to be exposed to anything different from what they are used to hearing, and the richness of the college experience will be diluted for everyone. \n\nThe frustration that many high school seniors feel is that they work hard, hit the checkboxes for admission to the top school of their choice (SAT score, leadership positions, extracurriculars) and they still don\u2019t get in. That is because there is likely 100 people who applied with the same profile as you. They could randomly choose anyone of you, and get the same piece needed for their freshman class diversity quilt. If Asian-Americans are disproportionately applying to the same top tier programs (relative to their make-up in the general population), they are making it harder for themselves to get in. Just think about how Stuyvesant in New York City, the city\u2019s leading public high school, is **74%** Asian\u2014and they are all applying to the same universities. An Asian-American student from there is competing against other students at Stuyvesant, not the poor black kid from South Carolina. And if the poor black kid doesn\u2019t have a comparable SAT score (25th -75th percentile), it\u2019s unlikely he or she will be admitted. Blacks and hispanics are not cutting Asian-Americans in line for spots at universities. \n\n*Related tangent*: The reasoning that Affirmative Action is racist and should be abolished is dog whistling racism that is now the norm in our society. Racists are not monsters. They don\u2019t wear hoods and burn crosses, lynch, or fire bomb black churches en masse like they used to. They have families, take good care of their dogs, and are generally law-abiding citizens who are probably struggling with making ends meet just like the rest of us.  Racism is also no longer the same\u2014no one is going around saying, \u201cI hate X\u201d or \u201cF*$@ that [group]\u201d explicitly. No. It is now a deep-seated, insidious belief that welfare and social programs (which have been proven time and again to overwhelmingly benefit Whites) such as the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, federal aid to states, Affirmative action, social security, Planned Parenthood, federal farm subsidies, welfare,  etc. are going to Blacks, Hispanics, and immigrants who are \u201ccutting in line\u201d and preventing Whites from getting ahead. Conservative think tanks and White supremacy groups have done a wonderful job of tying these programs to ethnic minority groups. And by opposing these programs one thinks they will be starving those undeserving ethnic minorities who are mooching and not earning anything for themselves.\n\nFor immigrants, or 1st or 2nd generation immigrants, I\u2019ve noticed there is no appreciation of the history of oppression of African-Americans in the United States, nor a willingness to understand it and why programs like Affirmative Action are in place.

That doesn't do anything to correct for bias within a school district, but it corrects for demographic skews and socioeconomic factors that affect entire towns. If you're in a school district that has a lot of high-performing students, this lowers your chance of acceptance, because you have to be in the top 10% to get one of those slots, even if the second 10% at your school is performing better than the top 10% at many other schools.
