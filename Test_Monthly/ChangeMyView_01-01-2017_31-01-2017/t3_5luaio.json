The link you have is to the B.C. legislation, which just covers electronic devices, but you also seem to be citing stuff from Alberta (the makeup, eating, etc).  \n\nIf you're talking about the B.C. law, it appears to only regulate electronic devices, and thus not to cover things like eating.\n\nIf you're talking about the Alberta law, it states:\n\n\"Subject to this section and the regulations made under section 115.5, no individual shall drive or operate a vehicle on a highway while engaged in an activity that distracts the individual from the operation of the vehicle, including but not limited to...\" (it then lists a bunch of things).  \n\nNote the \"not limited to\".  So, in Alberta if you allow your dog to run around distracting you, that would probably count as an offence.  \n\nThat said, I'm an Albertan, and I have dogs.  They sit in the back seat and they sleep, and have never attempted to gain access to the front of the vehicle.  I don't see any cause to have to install a barrier when there's no issue there.
