There's pride as in being happy about a positive quality in yourself, whether inherently or because of an accomplishment, and then there's pride as in the opposite of shame. When people say they're proud to be black, what they mean is they're not ashamed. We still live in a society that tells everyone black people are criminals, black men abandon their kids, black women are uglier than white women, black kids are thugs and sluts and troublemakers.

There&amp;#39;s pride as in being happy about a positive quality in yourself, whether inherently or because of an accomplishment, and then there&amp;#39;s pride as in the opposite of shame. When people say they&amp;#39;re proud to be black, what they mean is they&amp;#39;re not ashamed. We still live in a society that tells everyone black people are criminals, black men abandon their kids, black women are uglier than white women, black kids are thugs and sluts and troublemakers. The idea of &amp;quot;black pride&amp;quot; is the idea that being black isn&amp;#39;t something to be ashamed of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being white, on the other hand, isn&amp;#39;t something that&amp;#39;s looked down upon by society. There are certainly radical people who think white people need to feel guilty for the past and all that, but by and large, white people are still considered the default, the standard, the most relatable, the most trustworthy, all that. So a white person saying their proud to be white isn&amp;#39;t saying, &amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t make me feel ashamed of my skin color&amp;quot; unless their literally in a situation where someone is attacking their race. In general, the statement addresses a society that doesn&amp;#39;t do that. So instead, it becomes pride in an accomplishment or inherent good quality, and that reeks of white supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbw85qo", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lj6ik/cmv_for_the_sake_of_consistency_black_pride_or/dbw85qo/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483365003.0, "author_flair_text": "67\u2206", "created_utc": 1483336203.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 34, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lj6ik", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lj6ik", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 55, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lj6ik", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lj6ik", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbx4c22", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dill0nfd", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dbwhhlb", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt; The point is that there are no equivalences in racial issues, and situations don't always have clear counterparts.
