I don't know what you mean.\n\nSure, a belief is warranted (or justified) if there is an epistemological reason to hold the belief. A person is rational if their beliefs are justified under the epistemological system they are operating (or should be operating for domain specific knowledge claims). \n\nBut, a belief that is rational need not be true! And as it happens there are also whole classes of paradoxes in epistemology where justified true beliefs can't be said to be knowledge. The Gettier paradox is one famous example. \n\nBasically being rational is no guarantee that one's beliefs are true nor is it a guarantee that one's beliefs can count as knowledge even when true.\n\nAll being rationality does is ensure that the methodology used to arrive at a belief that one claims to be knowledge is logically valid. It in no way ensures the knowledge claim is correct in and of itself. \n\nThe end result of all this is that one can hold a belief rationally without there being empirical or objective evidence to the validity of the belief. And even if such evidence exists, the belief held can be rational and wrong, or rational, true, but held for incorrect reasons and thus not rational. \n\nIt's a non-trivial problem to consider what makes a validly held true belief valid. If one removes the requirement that the belief be true, the problem gets even more difficult. Because all that is required is that a person hold a worldview with basic assumptions underwhich the resulting belief is arrived at through rational means. However, the belief need not be defensible using any evidence that is empirically available to anyone but the believer. \n\n&gt;&gt; It also rests on the assumption that the terms under discussion (the \"omni's\") are in and of themselves intelligible. But just as we can talk about a square circle as if we can grasp that concept, it is not clear to me that we can simply toss \"omni\" in front of already poorly understood terms and make a meaningful concept. One of the basic concepts of Christianity, which is much more basic than any particular description of God, is that human beings are intrinsically sinful and thus incapable of fully understanding what \"good\" is in the first place.\n\n&gt; I don't think that there's anything particularly unintelligible about the concepts of knowing, doing, or goodness. I guess that if humans can't understand goodness, then it makes sense that God could be good in ways that don't seem good to us, but that's seems to me to bring up the question of who judges what goodness is in the first place. Why should we believe God is good if we don't know what good is?\n\nThere is an entire field of philosophy, called epistemology, that is all about figuring out what knowledge is and is not. People spend their entire lives trying to figure out what it means to \"know\" something. And the simple fact is that robust debate happens in dozens of journals on a regular basis. This would not happen if this were a simple idea that we clearly understood. \n\n\"Power\" for a non-corporal, spiritual being, who is claimed to exist without physical manifestation exernal to space-time is not an easily grasped concept as we have no reference for what it even means to exist outside of space-time let alone what a term that is all about exercising force against mass over time means for a being that does none of those things. \n\n\"Goodness\" is, if the primary claim of Christians that we are fallen is correct, is tautologically beyond our comprehension within the worldview Christians employ. \n\n&gt;&gt; This is a sticking point for someone who thinks that religious belief must be rational using only objective evidence. But it is not a sticking point for a fully rational person who accepts that some epistemically justified beliefs are justified on non-rational evidence. For example, I don't believe myself to love my wife because of the fact of the presence of certain chemicals in the neural synapses of the pleasure centers of my brain. Rather, I believe i love my wife because I experience love for my wife -- and it is wholly rational to accept that belief despite the fact that the evidence for the belief is precisely emotional and not objective.\n\n&gt; My issue isn't only that there isn't rational evidence for the existence of God. \n\nI would not have engaged in this debate if you were interested in me convincing you that there is a rational argument that would convince you that God exists. Your claim is that rational people can not believe in the Christian God. I am noting that there is a worldview that is rational under which belief in the Christian God is rational. I am not arguing that a rational belief is a justified true belief which obtains. \n\n\n", "edited": 1483650434.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, your point confuses a belief only being justified by rationally defensible evidence with a belief being rational.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you say more about this?

But just as we can talk about a square circle as if we can grasp that concept, it is not clear to me that we can simply toss &amp;quot;omni&amp;quot; in front of already poorly understood terms and make a meaningful concept. One of the basic concepts of Christianity, which is much more basic than any particular description of God, is that human beings are intrinsically sinful and thus incapable of fully understanding what &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; is in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think that there&amp;#39;s anything particularly unintelligible about the concepts of knowing, doing, or goodness. I guess that if humans can&amp;#39;t understand goodness, then it makes sense that God could be good in ways that don&amp;#39;t seem good to us, but that&amp;#39;s seems to me to bring up the question of who judges what goodness is in the first place. Why should we believe God is good if we don&amp;#39;t know what good is?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is an entire field of philosophy, called epistemology, that is all about figuring out what knowledge is and is not. People spend their entire lives trying to figure out what it means to &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; something. And the simple fact is that robust debate happens in dozens of journals on a regular basis. This would not happen if this were a simple idea that we clearly understood. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Power&amp;quot; for a non-corporal, spiritual being, who is claimed to exist without physical manifestation exernal to space-time is not an easily grasped concept as we have no reference for what it even means to exist outside of space-time let alone what a term that is all about exercising force against mass over time means for a being that does none of those things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Goodness&amp;quot; is, if the primary claim of Christians that we are fallen is correct, is tautologically beyond our comprehension within the worldview Christians employ. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a sticking point for someone who thinks that religious belief must be rational using only objective evidence. But it is not a sticking point for a fully rational person who accepts that some epistemically justified beliefs are justified on non-rational evidence. For example, I don&amp;#39;t believe myself to love my wife because of the fact of the presence of certain chemicals in the neural synapses of the pleasure centers of my brain. Rather, I believe i love my wife because I experience love for my wife -- and it is wholly rational to accept that belief despite the fact that the evidence for the belief is precisely emotional and not objective.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My issue isn&amp;#39;t only that there isn&amp;#39;t rational evidence for the existence of God. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would not have engaged in this debate if you were interested in me convincing you that there is a rational argument that would convince you that God exists. Your claim is that rational people can not believe in the Christian God. I am noting that there is a worldview that is rational under which belief in the Christian God is rational. I am not arguing that a rational belief is a justified true belief which obtains. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc1q0qe", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5m7oec/cmv_believing_in_the_christian_god_doesnt_make/dc1q0qe/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483678940.0, "author_flair_text": "22\u2206", "created_utc": 1483650140.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc1grzw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "palacesofparagraphs", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc1f5c3", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt;Lastly, your point confuses a belief only being justified by rationally defensible evidence with a belief being rational.\n\nCan you say more about this?

There needed to be common-sense building codes that reduced the chance for fires to get to a point where they will burn the surrounding neighborhoods, and 3. doing these things would increase the goodness that society would have done, by reducing fire deaths ad infinitum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I think chronic illnesses are a sign we need national healthcare, but that is a much less popular opinion. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc3lsn1", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5m7oec/cmv_believing_in_the_christian_god_doesnt_make/dc3lsn1/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483778094.0, "author_flair_text": "15\u2206", "created_utc": 1483749294.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m7oec", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc3dhjq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DeltaBot", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc3dgpv", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/ghotier ([21\u2206](/r/changemyview/wiki/user/ghotier)).\n\n^[Delta\u00a0System\u00a0Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)\n[\u200b](HTTP://DB3PARAMSSTART\n{\n  \"comment\": \"This is hidden text for DB3 to parse.

I don't subscribe to any denomination but I have found some answers to your questions in the Bible-as a whole. Some christians may not agree with me but here goes.\n\nIn the Bible there are three main \"pivots\" that God makes when it comes to His relationship with us. The first is in regards to your question about humans being instinctually evil. And that begins with the story of Adam and Eve. In the beginning the Bible describes a place where we lived with God and everything was \"good\". If you read on in the story you see that immediately after eating from the \"tree of the knowledge of good and evil\". Adam and Eve realize they are naked and cover themselves. So even though they knew God had no problem with them being naked they now have the knowledge of good and evil and have determined themselves that being naked is wrong. Suddenly what seemed to be instinct/natural is now a moral dilemma after the fall-why? Well because the knowledge that we were  in fact not living up to Gods standards (which were not meant to be met in the first place) now consumed our way of life. So God sends us out of the garden and covers us- giving us over to our own desire and the longest lesson that humanity has ever seen.  It's not that our instincts are bad or different from anything else on earth- it's our knowledge of them that makes us reconsider them. \n\nSo now we go from living with God to him being an outsider in our lives- the second pivot (or first?). And we see this struggle throughout the Old Testament. God does in fact intervene personally with natural disasters (plagues) and protecting his prophets, winning wars and showing up in a figurative sense (talking snakes, donkeys, burning bush, parting of the Red Sea),. He does exactly what you are asking him to do and it's effing brutal. Lots of bad (and seemingly good) people are killed, entire nationalities are destroyed etc etc. and although at the time the people involved were probably like \"uhhh wtf God.\" In hindsight we see the purpose was to keep His people prosperous so that a savior could be born according to prophecy (bloodlines, demographic etc). Meanwhile, He sets up the law (because we ask him to) and commits us to not only the Ten Commandments but about 600+ new laws that he himself follows, naturally. And it's hard, and we know we're bad, and we think God hates us, and we keep messing up. And God is like  I told you guys you didn't suck then YOU WENT AGAINST MY WARNING and found out just how much you suck compared to me and now you want to solidify your suckiness by following these rules and trying to be exactly like me for the next millennial...FINE.  But He's like, it's cool, I have this son that's going to make everything good again, and I won't have to keep doing this shite - it will all be on you guys and maybe you will learn something about humility.\n\nThird and final-ish pivot. Jesus comes and is like, you guys all suck, but it's not your fault-kinda. I'm just going to die and take all your badness with me and leave you with the Holy Spirit so you don't have to worry about it anymore. You're all good, just believe in me and when you die, I'll make sure you get to live with God again. So after his death we get the Holy Spirit and it's like great because it makes us feel good. And helps us better ourselves and it's like a piece of God connecting all of us- here on earth. And it has the potential to change the world!!! But some people choose not to acknowledge that Spirit. And some people choose to go against it. And SOME PEOPLE WOULD STILL RATHER FOLLOW SOME 600 OR SO LAWS IN ORDER TO HAVE CONTROL AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEIR INCREDIBLY TRYING RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD BY PUTTING OTHERS DOWN ABOUT THEIR SHORTFALLS AND NOT LETTING THEM INTO FELLOWSHIP AND PEACEFUL LIVING WITH CHRIST. But I digress.\n\n\nHere we see three \"phases\" of God being an instructor in our lives, never leaving or changing just ...adapting. If you will. Which is also where we get the trinity and the importance of each Godhead. Now that we're under the conditioning of the Holy Spirit it important to note that God does not punish or bless us according to our faith or works. Since Jesus came and leveled the playing field - that's no longer an issue. The issue is that God leaves us to our own natural consequences, like any good parent. Death is also a natural consequence. But he gave us the opportunity of life and showed us how to get the most out of it through Christ too. So yeah bad stuff happens but it doesn't negate all the good that happens too. \n\nAnyways I kind of got on a tangent but that's my worldview.

He knew he was wrong and was ashamed afterwards. Good is good because God is good. The law of morality answers to him, he does not answer to it.

Fortunately for us he is good, and we discern our moral compass by him. I think your position of questioning God comes from the disbelief in him existing, or at least being a good God.\n\nThis is exactly my point. You say we're fortunate that God is good since he has power over us. I agree that if he has power over us, it's better if he's good, but how do we know he's good? Many people in this thread have said that the reason God sometimes seems to do things that are wrong is that we as human beings can't fully comprehend goodness. However, if I can't comprehend goodness, how do I know I'm not worshipping a God that's evil, as you propose he isn't but could potentially be.\n\n&gt;Why worship a God who does things that seems to some to be wrong? Because he is the judge, creator and father of his creation. What your asking is why have faith in God even though it may not be convenient, easy or you disagree. The answer is because he says so.

Maybe we can write off evil by saying it's a result of free will.

Some suffering is worse than others, but I think all suffering is bad to the person experiencing it. It may be necessary to experience joy (you can't be happy if you've never been sad and all that) and it may lead to good things (a bad breakup is painful but puts you in position to meet someone better), but I still think it's bad. And while small or even medium levels of suffering can be necessary for greater levels of good, as in the above examples, it seems to me like some suffering is so great as to be unnecessary, like dying in a tsunami.\n\n&gt;Finally, people find comfort in God for many reasons. The most obvious to me is existential: how does one derive self worth? If you believe you are a child of God and that someone -anyone- cares for you, you feel better. It supplies importance to your existence and your actions.\n\nThis is definitely true. My issue is that to me it doesn't make sense to be comforted by that. I would be real angry if I found out God was looking out for me and everyone I know, because I think he's doing a shit job in many cases.

Some suffering is worse than others, but I think all suffering is bad to the person experiencing it.
