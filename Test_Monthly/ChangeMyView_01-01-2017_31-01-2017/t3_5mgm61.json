Landlords occasionally will refuse to give you a lease or else disallow you to keep your firearms on their property. Pretty much every business is a &amp;quot;gun free zone&amp;quot; or prohibits firearms, refusing entry to those who carry--even if you have a government issued license to carry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be clear, that does not happen &lt;em&gt;frequently&lt;/em&gt;, but it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; happen, often enough to make every gun owner I know very reticent to tell anyone about their hobby. I know of two other gun enthusiasts at my work place and we all keep it to ourselves for the most part, only talking to each other about it in hushed tones. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By contrast, any business which refuses entry to a transsexual is going to be sued out of existence--ditto for employers who fire/refuse to hire a transsexual for being a transsexual, or a landlord who refuses to give a lease to a transsexual/bank who refuses to give them a loan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Much more common is social ostracizing. In my experience there are very few bigots in California. Californians have an amazing tolerance for any kind of sexual preference, any kind of gender, and in general has a &amp;quot;live and let live&amp;quot; attitude to pretty much everyone--except gun owners. Attitudes in general among Californians seem to regard gun owners as little better than child molesters. Politicians certainly speak of gun owners as all being potential criminals, and in the words of many ordinary people, and even some politicians, there&amp;#39;s nothing &amp;#39;potential&amp;#39; about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been privy to many conversations among friends and acquaintances where my politics and hobbies are unknown, and people have genuine disdain for gun owners. Most people don&amp;#39;t actually know anyone who owns guns, and they unabashedly use the crudest of stereotypes to understand them: that we are all racist rednecks (and, of course, straight, white men) who all aspire to someday use our guns to murder someone. Not only do Californians generally assume that anyone who isn&amp;#39;t straight, white, and male won&amp;#39;t own guns, but the gay community actually outcasts gay people who exercise their right to keep and bear arms (or so I hear from some of the gay members of my local shooting range and &lt;a href=\"/r/CAGuns\"&gt;r/CAGuns&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s when we get to the legal situation that the argument is ironclad, in my opinion (but I am open to being wrong). The government of California currently protects transsexuals from discrimination in a variety of ways, whereas the same government is making it as difficult as possible for gun owners to practice their hobby/exercise their rights. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carrying an unloaded gun over one&amp;#39;s shoulder or in a holster (&amp;quot;open carry&amp;quot;, legal in most states, sometimes with no permit required) was declared illegal by the State Legislature and signed into law by Jerry Brown. Many counties (such as Alameda or Los Angeles) in California refuse to issue any licenses to carry a concealed handgun in public, and police within those counties will often refuse to recognize as valid licenses issued by other counties (and California refuses to recognize &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; concealed carry permit from any other state). As a result, in large swathes of California it is de facto illegal to carry a gun in public, concealed or openly, licensed or unlicensed. Is there even possible an analogous situation for transsexuals? Somewhere in California where it is illegal to be trans or where one is forbidden by the government from openly being inter-sex?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More egregiously, many city councils and county governments make it impossible for gun stores to open or for current ones to remain open. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;San Leandro in Alameda County is currently embroiled in a lawsuit because their zoning laws are so stringent, minute, arcane, and restrictive that it is effectively impossible for a gun store to open. Some businessmen however thought they had found a suitable location but are now involved in a bitter legal dispute. But can youimagine a world where a transsexual health clinic is not allowed to exist within &lt;a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/27/san-francisco-appeals-court-to-reconsider-challenge-to-alameda-county-gun-store-law/\"&gt;500 feet&lt;/a&gt; of &amp;quot;residential zones, schools, liquor stores or other &lt;del&gt;gun stores&lt;/del&gt; transsexual health clinics&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/San-Francisco-s-last-gun-shop-gives-up-the-fight-6601929.php\"&gt;San Francisco&amp;#39;s last gun store closed&lt;/a&gt; a year or so ago, making San Francisco quite possibly the largest city and county in the entire country with no legal gun stores at all within its limits. The city council of San Francisco &lt;em&gt;hated&lt;/em&gt; guns, gun owners, and gun stores &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; that they wrote and adopted a law &lt;em&gt;specifically designed&lt;/em&gt; to drive SF&amp;#39;s last remaining gun store out of business. The law in question required that the owner of the gun store record every transaction on CCTV and provide that to the police. From the SF Chronicle:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The legislation, sponsored by Supervisor Mark Farrell, is symbolic of the city\u2019s enduring distaste for what was sold inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFrom my perspective, if the last gun store in San Francisco wants to close its doors because of my legislation, so be it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis store sold over 1,000 guns each year. I would much rather have a preschool or coffee store in the neighborhood than a gun shop.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine a government official anywhere in California saying &amp;quot;From my perspective, if the last transsexual health clinic in our city has to close because of this law, so be it. I don&amp;#39;t want a tranny doctor in our town&amp;quot;? No? Can you think of a single city in California where the city council would go to great lengths to prevent a trans-friendly or trans-oriented business from opening, even going so far as actively try to shut it down through legislation? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do transsexuals lose their right to privacy for being trans? Gun owners do. In addition to the law passed in SF requiring the gun store record every transaction with CCTV and provide the footage to police, gun owners must provide the government their names, addresses, and fingerprints whenever they buy a gun, as if we are criminals, and now with the most recently passed legislation coming into effect, gun owners are required to register their &amp;quot;assault weapons&amp;quot; and surrender, destroy, sell, or modify their magazines which hold more than 10 rounds. Are trans people required to register with the government? Is there anything so equivalently invasive in the life of a trans person?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that is in addition to the myriad laws about the kinds of guns we can own. I could go on in great detail, but imagine if the government of California said &amp;quot;Trans people can get breast implants, but only implants between 200 and 250 cc&amp;#39;s are allowed&amp;quot;--that&amp;#39;s the kind of stupidity gun owners have to put up with, and it is only getting worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So go ahead, change my view: it&amp;#39;s easier and more acceptable to more people in California to be a transsexual than a gun owner. In other words: gun owners are California&amp;#39;s most oppressed minority group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello, users of CMV!

Browsing through the other comments it seems a lot of people have made this (mistaken) assumption that I am comparing *being* trans to *owning* a gun. I am not, and of course they are not comparable. I am saying that it is currently easier to exist as a trans-person in California than a gun owner, because the trans-person will face fewer legal and societal repercussions for who/what they are.\n\nPut it another way: everyone has the right to be trans, and they should be free to lead their lives as the gender they think they are, and every law abiding citizen should be free to own guns. Currently, the trans people are freer, enjoy more legal protections, and face less societal discrimination than gun owners do. In other words: **a trans-person and gun owner will face more discrimination, legal hassle, and overall difficulty in being a gun owner than they will for being trans.**\n\n\nCarrying a gun in public is a big part of gun ownership for many (though, incidentally, not myself). Indeed, the 2nd Amendment specifically protects carrying guns in public (it's that bit about the right to \"bear arms\"). To deny people their right to carry a gun lawfully and in public is a bigger injustice than anything trans people currently face in California, and it is happening on a far larger scale than any injustices trans people currently endure--arguably anywhere in the US.\n\n&gt;One is a behavior which you are conciously selecting &amp; the other is a sexual orientation.\n\nExcept I don't get to *choose* whether I am the victim of a crime or not; I can choose if I am an armed victim or not. Denying people their right to carry a gun is putting their very life at risk, as well as denying them freedoms which all Americans have by right, and that is a greater injustice than anything currently being done to trans people in California. \n\nTo reiterate: in many parts of California, there is a systematic (and largely successful) effort by the government to strip people of their rights to carry a gun in public, part of a larger concerted (if incomplete) effort to strip people of their right to own guns in general, a form of persecution executed to a degree no transperson in California currently has to deal with. Unless you care to cite an example?\n\n&gt; Also, a person with a gun is a deadly threat to whoever they choose. A transexual poses no more threat than any other person. \n\nIrrelevant, it does not change the fact that gun owners are being denied their rights arbitrarily and unjustly, in marked contrast to trans-people who have all their freedoms and rights respected (as far as I am aware) by the State of California. \n\n&gt;You don't lose your right to privacy.\n\nIn other words: we're not taking away your right to free speech, you can say anything you like as long as you agree to say only what the government approves of. Don't like it? Don't say anything. Put another way: you're no losing your right to an abortion, unless you're saying you can't control whether you get pregnant or not! That's all a steaming pile of bullshit. \n\nWhy should I have to surrender, waive, or be denied (in other words **lose**) my privacy and let the government intrude on my life simply because I wish to exercise a Constitutionally protected right? What, how many, and whether I own guns is nobody's damned business, least of all the government's, and neither should I have to be fingerprinted like a common criminal or tell the government where I live every time I purchase a firearm. \n\nAgain, trans-people face no such incursion into their private lives by the government. \n\n&gt; in exchange for the right to own a gun\n\nThat's not how rights work! I don't have to give the government or exchange anything with the government to exercise my rights. I have rights by default, by virtue of being born human; the government can't take them away and then give them back to me with conditions. Again, trans-people are under no such obligation to surrender any of their rights in order to change gender.\n\n&gt;The fact that many powerful people are gun owners, but not many are transexuals.\n\nTotally immaterial, but I would point out that actually that all powerful people are gun owners--in that powerful people are either rich people protected with armed security (paying for gun ownership by proxy) or else are members of the government/ruling class and are thus not only protected by guns but can order men with guns to commit violence upon others on their behalf. \n\nAnd it's irrelevant. Lots of powerful people are gun owners eh? Well fat load of good it does *the average gun owner* who is seeing his/her ability to exercise the right to keep/bear arms being steadily eroded in California, whereas the lot of the average transsexual is improving. \n\nAnd while trans-people are disproportionately victims of crime, many gun owners own guns *specifically* to avoid becoming victims of crime, and were it not for owning guns might possibly have similar rates of crime victimization to transsexuals. In other words, it's a bit unfair to claim that one group has it more difficult than the other simply because one has taken successful steps to mediate their difficulties. It is a legitimate point mind you, but I'm not entirely sure on that basis alone we can say trans-people have a more difficult time of it than gun owners. \n\n&gt;Not to mention relationships which are more complicated, more limited &amp; more dangerous for a transexual. \n\nThe same can be said of gun owners in California (minus the physical danger part, but again, I highly doubt that there is much *physical* danger for trans-people in California, unless you can provide some numbers?)\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Being transexual is not comparable&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re not meant to be.

Trans people care about relationships, and their ability to make and keep relationships with their family, friends, coworkers, lovers, etc. Legislation can&amp;#39;t make that happen and it can&amp;#39;t stop it from happening either. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc3meio", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5mgm61/cmv_its_easier_to_be_a_transsexual_in_california/dc3meio/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483778933.0, "author_flair_text": "11\u2206", "created_utc": 1483750133.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 4, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mgm61", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mgm61", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 6, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mgm61", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mgm61", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 5, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mgm61", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mgm61", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mgm61", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc47fun", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc40q4a", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "A single hobby is so integral to your whole being that you completely and utterly changed into a totally and utterly different person without it?
