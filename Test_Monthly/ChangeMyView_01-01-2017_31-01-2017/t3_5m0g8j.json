I want to give myself the best angle to see when that opening is coming.\n\nI need you to understand the basic math of the turn first. But the premise here is that since making the turn takes longer from the stoplight, even if you see marginally better, you have a smaller time window to make the turn.\n\n&gt;If you are stopped at the stop line then you accelerate so that your car gets to the opening when it appears. Going 5mph into the opening will get you through faster than starting at 0mph\n\nOk, I need to think of a way to illustrate this to you. It's hard because it's just evident to me. Basically we are talking about moving between three possible points.\n\nPoint A - At the light (where you propose we wait)\n\nPoint B - In the intersection (where most everybody waits)\n\nPoint C - Point where turn is completed.\n\nYou are saying that in your scenario you are moving from Point B to Point C more quickly. I agree! \n\nWhat I am saying is that moving from Point B to Point C takes a similar time (depending on the intersection layout) as moving from Point A to Point B. So while you get from B to C faster in your scenario, *you still have to get from A to B first*. Therefore, moving from A to B to C is greater than moving from B to C. \n\n&gt;In my experience this results in the cross traffic having to wait much longer for the intersection to clear. You might improve the left turn throughput by a car or two, but have likely reduced the throughput of the cross roads by more than that.\n\nI disagree. There is an inherent reaction time for cross driver traffic plus the amount of time it takes them accelerate. This allows left turners to clear the intersections safely, plus any delay built into the street light timing for this purpose. This fact is why left turn on red even exists in the first place. \n\nBut let's assume you are correct and it does meaningfully slow cross traffic. I would posit that cars going straight are far less likely to back up than cars taking a left hand turn. There are typically orders of magnitude more cars going straight than taking a left during a light cycle, so the impact of slowing a few cars of cross traffic down is much much lower from a % standpoint than preventing multiple left turners. \n\n&gt;The focus of the CMV was intended to be on these kinds of situations since they are the ones I encounter 95%+ of the time and still see people waiting in the intersection.\n\nMaybe it's habit? I think it's fine because the downsides (if they exist at all) are very minute. I know I do it because there are situations where even in medium to slow traffic times, oncoming traffic is spaced out *just* enough where I would miss a window if I had to start all the way back at the light, but can make it from the middle. \n\nBy discounting the situations when waiting in the intersection is meaningful you kind of make this an unchangeable view.

So waiting in the intersection is the best we have. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbzxqg7", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5m0g8j/cmv_when_making_a_left_turn_at_a_light_controlled/dbzxqg7/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483585825.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483557025.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 16, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m0g8j", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m0g8j", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 9, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m0g8j", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m0g8j", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 7, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m0g8j", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m0g8j", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m0g8j", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": -1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m0g8j", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m0g8j", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m0g8j", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc02gl6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "V1per41", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc02cts", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I'm rolling slowly so that I'm better prepared to accelerate when the opening gets to me.

They wouldn&amp;#39;t pull past the middle of intersection and they would pull towards their median, thus away from the sight lines.  That red box couldn&amp;#39;t even make the left turn from the position you show.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbzyd1s", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5m0g8j/cmv_when_making_a_left_turn_at_a_light_controlled/dbzyd1s/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483586514.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483557714.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbzy3yn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "V1per41", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dbzxecg", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I feel this is very similar to the example I posted in the OP.

Any car that has broken the plane of the intersection, or the white line, before a red light, has right of way in the intersection. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: grammar&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dbzv52l", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5m0g8j/cmv_when_making_a_left_turn_at_a_light_controlled/dbzv52l/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483582943.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483554143.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m0g8j", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m0g8j", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbzyuk5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BenIncognito", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dbzy18y", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Sorry Rec1umWrecker, your comment has been removed: \n\n&gt; Comment Rule 1\\. \"Direct responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OP\u2019s current view (however minor), unless they are asking a clarifying question.
