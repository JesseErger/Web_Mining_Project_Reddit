They confuse emotional intimacy with physical intimacy, being one of the few socially acceptable ways they can achieve something resembling connection. Women don&amp;#39;t have this problem and so don&amp;#39;t feel the same level of urgency to seek out an SO.

For example, a woman being completely unable to leave an abusive husband might expose her own *son* to physical, emotional or sexual abuse. Some religiously restrictive patriarchal societies, such as the Amish or Mennonite culture, has concepts such as \"shunning\" to punish men who act like animals towards their own families. This still happens today within their society, despite them all agreeing that men are morally superior headships of the household.  \nThere needs to be some sort of line where men or women may not cross as far as emotional, financial, sexual, physical abuse or exploitation may not occur.  \nThe idea that martial abandonment being unheard of prior to 1965 or whatever is also false. I have examples within my own run-of-the-mill family history where a husband or wife literally ran off without a trace, leaving the remainder of the broken family penniless-- both examples I can think of from the late 1800s.   \nI've been through a custody dispute myself. I could hardly call myself wealthy or well off under any circumstances. Most of my family chose to side with my ex, as they also sided with the \"men\" in regards to two other divorces within my family. The two other women who were divorced within my family, were accused of being every unimaginable thing under the sun while being forced to **pay their husbands alimony**. Let me see, without proof we three women were / all blackballed as crazy, whores, gold-diggers by our own families no less... Our respective exes as \"Good Guys Who Deserved Better\". If it makes you feel better, many women still get punished for not \"standing by their man\". Witch burning lives on today.   \nPerhaps the region I live in is more apt to pay men the benefit of the doubt, but the stereotype of the high-flying-glam-single-mom-with-child-and-penthouse is not universally true-- it's more the material of daytime TV.  \nI will admit that there are definitely scummy women out there. One man I know of was dealt very badly, but the main reason was that his ex had a wealthy family with limitless income to use to pay lawyers. As far as family court is concerned, I'm fairly certain having large funds with which to pay lawyers probably creates the largest advantage for either party. Disparity in family court should be dealt with, no doubt, to rule on the best interest of the children and no one else.  \n***Men were never guaranteed wives. Women were never guaranteed husbands.*** This was the stuff from Edwardian romance novels and myths. Many points in history, the only women guaranteed husbands or men guaranteed wives the ones with dowries or established trades. Pigeon-holing marital traditions does not apply to all cultures, even within a continent (example: Europe).  \nI know of very very few women who can survive financially on their own, let alone men. I know of plenty women, however, who've had their boyfriends/ ex-husbands take out numerous credit cards  and/or student loans in either their names or their children's names, only to leave their women holding the bag of debt in the end.  \nThe whole TRP thing is bizarre and unnecessary, since hatred of women and the concept of male superiority is deeply ingrained in most people, even those who are so called \"liberal/progressive\".  Most of the TRP philosophy seems like strategic narcissism or emotional manipulation, wrapped up in tunnel vision idealism based on a hybrid of 1950s family sitcoms and Mad Men. The 1950s was not ideal, I have a few elderly female relatives married to executives during that time who could attest to it. Their husbands were sick, twisted, abusive people in their time, and left paths of land mines and destruction behind them. The extreme nature of it isn't necessary, and neither is the paranoia-- it's more likely to lead to mental illness and public violence than anything else.

Some religiously restrictive patriarchal societies, such as the Amish or Mennonite culture, has concepts such as &amp;quot;shunning&amp;quot; to punish men who act like animals towards their own families. This still happens today within their society, despite them all agreeing that men are morally superior headships of the household.&lt;br/&gt;\nThere needs to be some sort of line where men or women may not cross as far as emotional, financial, sexual, physical abuse or exploitation may not occur.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe idea that martial abandonment being unheard of prior to 1965 or whatever is also false. I have examples within my own run-of-the-mill family history where a husband or wife literally ran off without a trace, leaving the remainder of the broken family penniless-- both examples I can think of from the late 1800s.&lt;br/&gt;\nI&amp;#39;ve been through a custody dispute myself. I could hardly call myself wealthy or well off under any circumstances. Most of my family chose to side with my ex, as they also sided with the &amp;quot;men&amp;quot; in regards to two other divorces within my family. The two other women who were divorced within my family, were accused of being every unimaginable thing under the sun while being forced to &lt;strong&gt;pay their husbands alimony&lt;/strong&gt;. Let me see, without proof we three women were / all blackballed as crazy, whores, gold-diggers by our own families no less... Our respective exes as &amp;quot;Good Guys Who Deserved Better&amp;quot;. If it makes you feel better, many women still get punished for not &amp;quot;standing by their man&amp;quot;. Witch burning lives on today.&lt;br/&gt;\nPerhaps the region I live in is more apt to pay men the benefit of the doubt, but the stereotype of the high-flying-glam-single-mom-with-child-and-penthouse is not universally true-- it&amp;#39;s more the material of daytime TV.&lt;br/&gt;\nI will admit that there are definitely scummy women out there. One man I know of was dealt very badly, but the main reason was that his ex had a wealthy family with limitless income to use to pay lawyers. As far as family court is concerned, I&amp;#39;m fairly certain having large funds with which to pay lawyers probably creates the largest advantage for either party. Disparity in family court should be dealt with, no doubt, to rule on the best interest of the children and no one else.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Men were never guaranteed wives. Women were never guaranteed husbands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This was the stuff from Edwardian romance novels and myths. Many points in history, the only women guaranteed husbands or men guaranteed wives the ones with dowries or established trades. Pigeon-holing marital traditions does not apply to all cultures, even within a continent (example: Europe).&lt;br/&gt;\nI know of very very few women who can survive financially on their own, let alone men. I know of plenty women, however, who&amp;#39;ve had their boyfriends/ ex-husbands take out numerous credit cards  and/or student loans in either their names or their children&amp;#39;s names, only to leave their women holding the bag of debt in the end.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe whole TRP thing is bizarre and unnecessary, since hatred of women and the concept of male superiority is deeply ingrained in most people, even those who are so called &amp;quot;liberal/progressive&amp;quot;.  Most of the TRP philosophy seems like strategic narcissism or emotional manipulation, wrapped up in tunnel vision idealism based on a hybrid of 1950s family sitcoms and Mad Men. The 1950s was not ideal, I have a few elderly female relatives married to executives during that time who could attest to it. Their husbands were sick, twisted, abusive people in their time, and left paths of land mines and destruction behind them. The extreme nature of it isn&amp;#39;t necessary, and neither is the paranoia-- it&amp;#39;s more likely to lead to mental illness and public violence than anything else. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dciqm19", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5lurbi/cmv_either_women_have_equal_rights_leaving_most/dciqm19/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1484642017.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1484613217.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dcikm6u", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Preaddly", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dcif6qp", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt; Seriously, this is all about \"divide and conquer the little people to hate each other\" since ultimately without working together or compromising, families fail, social connections become weak and the wealthiest and most powerful people can thereby control us.

Now that women are free to create their own wealth they don't need husbands anymore, though they may still want to be married to men they genuinely love. My original point was that there's no middle ground here, either men are guaranteed a wife meaning women have fewer rights or women have rights and not as many men will ever get married. And now the robots are displacing them in the workplace too making it even harder for them to seem attractive. I think TRP is an intelligent animal's logical conclusion to a problem it can't fix.
