Thank you for the very thorough post. I'm often frustrated by the lack of clarity and nuance and discussions about abortion, but you have done an excellent job of showing that both sides have strong arguments that are plausible, but I would like to attempt to show that the Pro-Life position is superior even when fully accepting the difficulties in the epistemology of personhood.\n\n\nAllow me to use an analogy: \n\n\nImagine a person is in a room with a line of dominoes that are arranged in such a way that tipping over a specific domino will eventually lead to all the dominoes tipping. Let's also say that the last domino in the chain that would fall over is the only red domino.\n\n\nThe person in the room observes all this and departs the room without doing anything. A man goes to our subject and angrily claims that he stopped the red domino from tipping over by not tipping over the first domino. Our subject is defensive, claiming that they did not prevent the red domino from falling, and rightfully so in my opinion. Not beginning a process is distinctly different from stopping one.\n\n\nLet us imagine this same scenario, but the subject tips over the first domino in the chain. One by one, the tiles begin to tip and fall. Suddenly, our subject has a change of heart and decides that he would really rather for the last domino, the red one, to remain standing. The subject rushes down the chain and removes a few of the white dominoes that are still standing. This disrupts the process and the red domino never falls. \n\n\nIn this scenario too, our subject is confronted and accused of preventing the red domino from falling. Our subject may say that technically it was an earlier, white, domino that was prevented from falling. While this is technically correct, I think it is intuitive and clear that removing the white domino also communicates the responsibility of preventing the red domino from falling. \n\n\nFrom my perspective, the red domino falling is equivalent to personhood entering the world and removing an earlier white domino is equivalent to an abortion. Even if a fetus is not yet a person, barring interference, it **will** become a person. Knowing this, I consider the interference of its personhood developing the moral equivalent of the interference of an adult life, aka murder.\n\n\nWhile I believe that we have no positive moral obligation to begin the process of a person entering the world, once the process is in motion interfering with it at any point is morally wrong.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there!

I&amp;#39;m often frustrated by the lack of clarity and nuance and discussions about abortion, but you have done an excellent job of showing that both sides have strong arguments that are plausible, but I would like to attempt to show that the Pro-Life position is superior even when fully accepting the difficulties in the epistemology of personhood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Allow me to use an analogy: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine a person is in a room with a line of dominoes that are arranged in such a way that tipping over a specific domino will eventually lead to all the dominoes tipping. Let&amp;#39;s also say that the last domino in the chain that would fall over is the only red domino.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The person in the room observes all this and departs the room without doing anything. A man goes to our subject and angrily claims that he stopped the red domino from tipping over by not tipping over the first domino. Our subject is defensive, claiming that they did not prevent the red domino from falling, and rightfully so in my opinion. Not beginning a process is distinctly different from stopping one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let us imagine this same scenario, but the subject tips over the first domino in the chain. One by one, the tiles begin to tip and fall. Suddenly, our subject has a change of heart and decides that he would really rather for the last domino, the red one, to remain standing. The subject rushes down the chain and removes a few of the white dominoes that are still standing. This disrupts the process and the red domino never falls. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this scenario too, our subject is confronted and accused of preventing the red domino from falling. Our subject may say that technically it was an earlier, white, domino that was prevented from falling. While this is technically correct, I think it is intuitive and clear that removing the white domino also communicates the responsibility of preventing the red domino from falling. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From my perspective, the red domino falling is equivalent to personhood entering the world and removing an earlier white domino is equivalent to an abortion. Even if a fetus is not yet a person, barring interference, it &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; become a person. Knowing this, I consider the interference of its personhood developing the moral equivalent of the interference of an adult life, aka murder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I believe that we have no positive moral obligation to begin the process of a person entering the world, once the process is in motion interfering with it at any point is morally wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc0fsxv", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5m17gg/cmv_prochoice_and_prolife_stances_are_both/dc0fsxv/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483606742.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483577942.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m17gg", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m17gg", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m17gg", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m17gg", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc5hbl2", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Exacting", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc5gms1", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt; legally obligated\n\nI don't think this case has come up in any courts I know of, so we'll have to wait and see ;)\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;legally obligated&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think this case has come up in any courts I know of, so we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see ;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc5hbl2", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5m17gg/cmv_prochoice_and_prolife_stances_are_both/dc5hbl2/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483895765.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483866965.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc5gms1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CunningAllusionment", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc5flol", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "The thing is, if a doctor told you, \"Will you let me put this IV in you?

(so that&amp;#39;s one reason.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think this is a good reason, but I think we need a different reason for cases in which the person is fairly isolated. I don&amp;#39;t think the friendless chump can be killed just because his loss won&amp;#39;t be noted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since this person is not suffering, does not know they have ever existed, from their point of view, bringing them back would be a positive but leaving them that way would almost be neutral. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suppose they will come back (pregnancy and birth) but you kill them first.

I think this is different because I think that the concept \"I am a Christian and think everyone must be\" is indefensible, whereas I think the concept \"I am pro-life and think every human life should be protected\" IS defensible.\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\n&gt; Yes, that's what I want to claim. And I think that claim is not that \"this position SHOULD anything,\" just that this position is defensible, even though it has the embedded desire to override the opposite opinion. I don't think this relies on that internal, trivial, 'should.'\n\nOkay, so we're using the non-trivial \"should\" here. Meaning when you say the pro-life position is morally defensible, you don't just mean it's morally defensible from the perspective of pro-lifers. You mean it's morally defensible independent of anyone's perspective. If that is true, then your earlier critique against M (where you said that it would be morally defensible for people to forcefully prevent an action so long as they *believed* they were preventing a morally indefensible action) does not apply, since it doesn't matter what a person believes when determining if their actions are morally defensible. So do you have any other issues with M?\n\n&gt; Isn't this what the whole pro-life debate is about?\n\nThis section of my post was a minor point and, looking back at the post, it causes unneeded confusion and I should have not included. Feel free to ignore this part. But if you are interested in what I meant, here's an explanation. But again, feel free to skip this.\n\nYes, the pro-life debate is about rights, but the kind of rights allocated to fetuses in the pro-life debate are a bit different than the kind of rights I was referring to. We can probably split common usage of the term \"rights\" into at least two categories (this is by no means exhaustive): \n\n1. The first kind of rights are rights that that prohibit/obligate certain actions from others. For example, many say that we all have a right to education - what this effectively means is that the government is obligated to provide education for everyone. These are the sorts of rights involved in the pro-life debate are rights, since the pro-life position entails that mothers are prohibited from detaching their fetus if doing so will kill the fetus. But this is not what I was referring to earlier.\n\n2. The second kind of rights are rights that are basically synonyms for morally permissible actions. For example, imagine that Joe bought a painting from Steve in a consensual transaction. Now, in ordinary circumstances, you would probably say that this was a morally permissible action by Joe (i.e. Joe did nothing wrong in this exchange). Another person might attempt to convey this very same sentiment by saying Joe acted in his \"rights\" in this transaction. But all they mean with this usage of \"rights\" is that Joe did nothing morally wrong. They probably don't think that Joe has a right to this transaction in the above sense, since that would mean Steven has an obligation to sell Joe the painting, but that's probably not what was meant. This is what I was referring to earlier, but these types of rights aren't typically given to fetuses.\n\n&gt; To be completely honest, I got lost in this part of your argument (my fault), but my instinct is that if the fetus does have the right to prevent the abortion (without interference), the right must be protected, in the same way that if an accused person cannot afford a lawyer, the state provides one. If you have the time/interest to re-represent this part of the argument in simple English without letters (for the sake of my limited ability to follow) I'd love to try again!\n\nBased on your reply, it looks like you understood what I was trying to explain for the most part. But I'll reiterate. But firstly, I just noticed that I should have never used the word \"rights\". I'm not sure why I started using \"rights\" but it was certainly a mistake on my part. The concept of rights carries a lot of baggage that I do not wish to bring into the discussion. What I should have said was \"it is morally defensible for him to do ...\" rather than \"he has a right to do...\". With that in mind, here's my reiteration:\n\nI'm basically saying that it would be morally defensible for the group of people involved in the procedure (i.e. the mother, fetus and doctor) to prevent the procedure from taking place *with that group of people* (the reason I say \"with that group of people\" is because it is okay for the doctor to prevent the procedure from taking place *with himself*, but it is not okay for the doctor to prevent the procedure from taking place with another doctor). Hence, it would be morally defensible for the fetus to prevent the procedure from taking place. The reason is because the fetus is involved in the procedure. But anyone other than the fetus doctor or mother is not involved in the procedure; it would therefore be morally indefensible for them to forcefully prevent the procedure.\n\nIf I am correct, then everything that I just said follows after you accept M. Therefore, if you still disagree, then that means you disagree with M and we can take a step back and discuss the merits of M instead.\n\n&gt; I'm afraid I don't take these two as equivalent, as I think my not being able to is not a moral flaw, but a practical one.\n\nI'm not really sure what you mean by this then. If you do accept (a) M, and you accept (b) that abortion is morally defensible, and you accept (c) that abortion does not significantly harm outside parties in the right way, and you accept (d) that the acting agents in the procedure are fully informed, then it follows that the pro-life position is morally indefensible. So I'm not really sure where I should reply.

I think this is different because I think that the concept &amp;quot;I am a Christian and think everyone must be&amp;quot; is indefensible, whereas I think the concept &amp;quot;I am pro-life and think every human life should be protected&amp;quot; IS defensible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the difference?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, that&amp;#39;s what I want to claim.

I don&amp;#39;t think this relies on that internal, trivial, &amp;#39;should.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, so we&amp;#39;re using the non-trivial &amp;quot;should&amp;quot; here. Meaning when you say the pro-life position is morally defensible, you don&amp;#39;t just mean it&amp;#39;s morally defensible from the perspective of pro-lifers. You mean it&amp;#39;s morally defensible independent of anyone&amp;#39;s perspective. If that is true, then your earlier critique against M (where you said that it would be morally defensible for people to forcefully prevent an action so long as they &lt;em&gt;believed&lt;/em&gt; they were preventing a morally indefensible action) does not apply, since it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what a person believes when determining if their actions are morally defensible. So do you have any other issues with M?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t this what the whole pro-life debate is about?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This section of my post was a minor point and, looking back at the post, it causes unneeded confusion and I should have not included. Feel free to ignore this part. But if you are interested in what I meant, here&amp;#39;s an explanation. But again, feel free to skip this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, the pro-life debate is about rights, but the kind of rights allocated to fetuses in the pro-life debate are a bit different than the kind of rights I was referring to. We can probably split common usage of the term &amp;quot;rights&amp;quot; into at least two categories (this is by no means exhaustive): &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first kind of rights are rights that that prohibit/obligate certain actions from others. For example, many say that we all have a right to education - what this effectively means is that the government is obligated to provide education for everyone. These are the sorts of rights involved in the pro-life debate are rights, since the pro-life position entails that mothers are prohibited from detaching their fetus if doing so will kill the fetus. But this is not what I was referring to earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second kind of rights are rights that are basically synonyms for morally permissible actions. For example, imagine that Joe bought a painting from Steve in a consensual transaction. Now, in ordinary circumstances, you would probably say that this was a morally permissible action by Joe (i.e. Joe did nothing wrong in this exchange). Another person might attempt to convey this very same sentiment by saying Joe acted in his &amp;quot;rights&amp;quot; in this transaction. But all they mean with this usage of &amp;quot;rights&amp;quot; is that Joe did nothing morally wrong. They probably don&amp;#39;t think that Joe has a right to this transaction in the above sense, since that would mean Steven has an obligation to sell Joe the painting, but that&amp;#39;s probably not what was meant. This is what I was referring to earlier, but these types of rights aren&amp;#39;t typically given to fetuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To be completely honest, I got lost in this part of your argument (my fault), but my instinct is that if the fetus does have the right to prevent the abortion (without interference), the right must be protected, in the same way that if an accused person cannot afford a lawyer, the state provides one. If you have the time/interest to re-represent this part of the argument in simple English without letters (for the sake of my limited ability to follow) I&amp;#39;d love to try again!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on your reply, it looks like you understood what I was trying to explain for the most part. But I&amp;#39;ll reiterate. But firstly, I just noticed that I should have never used the word &amp;quot;rights&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;m not sure why I started using &amp;quot;rights&amp;quot; but it was certainly a mistake on my part. The concept of rights carries a lot of baggage that I do not wish to bring into the discussion. What I should have said was &amp;quot;it is morally defensible for him to do ...&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;he has a right to do...&amp;quot;. With that in mind, here&amp;#39;s my reiteration:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m basically saying that it would be morally defensible for the group of people involved in the procedure (i.e. the mother, fetus and doctor) to prevent the procedure from taking place &lt;em&gt;with that group of people&lt;/em&gt; (the reason I say &amp;quot;with that group of people&amp;quot; is because it is okay for the doctor to prevent the procedure from taking place &lt;em&gt;with himself&lt;/em&gt;, but it is not okay for the doctor to prevent the procedure from taking place with another doctor). Hence, it would be morally defensible for the fetus to prevent the procedure from taking place. The reason is because the fetus is involved in the procedure. But anyone other than the fetus doctor or mother is not involved in the procedure; it would therefore be morally indefensible for them to forcefully prevent the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I am correct, then everything that I just said follows after you accept M. Therefore, if you still disagree, then that means you disagree with M and we can take a step back and discuss the merits of M instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid I don&amp;#39;t take these two as equivalent, as I think my not being able to is not a moral flaw, but a practical one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not really sure what you mean by this then. If you do accept (a) M, and you accept (b) that abortion is morally defensible, and you accept (c) that abortion does not significantly harm outside parties in the right way, and you accept (d) that the acting agents in the procedure are fully informed, then it follows that the pro-life position is morally indefensible. So I&amp;#39;m not really sure where I should reply. Either you must agree that the pro-life position is morally indefensible or you reject one of (a)-(d).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To prevent confusion, I feel it&amp;#39;s appropriate for me to ask if you accept M or not.

If we cannot prevent mothers from having the freedom to abort, so too, no mother should be able to prevent the person from having the freedom to live.\n\nRecall group Y and group X from M. Now, group Y includes the mother, the fetus and potentially the doctor. Group X can include anyone (whoever we think should be able to forcibly prevent actions among group Y). For example, if group X is the mother, the fetus or the doctor, then either of these individuals would have the right to prevent the abortion from occurring among group Y. For example, if the mother &amp; doctor are in group Y, then either of these individuals could prevent the abortion from occurring among group Y without ever initiating any force - they merely refrain from performing the abortion. This also means that the fetus should be able to prevent the abortion without prevention by people outside of group Y (but this is kind of irrelevant because (a) the fetus probably does not have this ability and (b) we don't typically assign moral rights and responsibilities to fetuses, so it's kind of useless to say what fetuses should be able to do).\n\nNow, if group X includes none of the individuals in group Y (the mother, fetus and/or doctor), then, if M is true, group X has no right to prevent an abortion from taking place among group Y (the mother, fetus and/or doctor).

I don't think this tips the scale in my current position.\n\nThis is true. Therefore, there are two options here: either (a) you come to believe the pro-choice position is indefensible, in which case you change your view; or (b) you continue to think the pro-life position is defensible, in which case (as you say) you cannot be pro-life; assuming you take \"I cannot be pro-life\" as \"I believe pro-life is morally indefensible\", then you have changed your view.

The moral question is whether people ought to be forcefully prevented from getting abortions. With that being said, I believe the following is an established/accepted basic moral claim that you have not considered: \n\n* It is morally indefensible for group X to forcefully prevent actions among members of group Y unless either (a) such actions are inherently morally indefensible, (b) the agents in group Y performing the actions are too uninformed/impaired to properly give consent or (c) not preventing such interactions will significantly harm the lives of those in group X. \n\nI will be referring to this as moral claim M from now on. Here are some caveats for M:\n\n* It is necessary that either condition (a) or (b) or (c) is true, but I'm not saying that it would be sufficient for one of these conditions to be true. The truth of either of these conditions might be sufficient, but I don't need to make that argument here.\n\n* Groups X and Y can be mutually exclusive, overlapping or identical. This isn't really important though.\n\n* When I say \"will significantly harm the lives of those in group X\", it cannot be something like mere feelings of suffering because of the fact that an action is committed. For example, we do not think it is morally defensible for Christians to force non-Christians to convert to Christianity because non-Christianity offends Christians. The reason is because practicing a non-Christian religion (or not practicing any religion) does not have a significant impact on the lives of Christians *in the right way* to justify forcefully preventing such actions. That is, *merely being upset with certain actions does not justify forcefully preventing such actions.* \n\nHere's why I believe moral claim M is established/accepted:\n\n* M explains why certain actions are outlawed. It trivially shows why morally indefensible actions are outlawed; for example, forcible rape, non-consensual torture, murder, etc. M also explains why we prevent actions that involve an uninformed or impaired person making important decisions on their life; for example, sex with intoxicated persons, minors and mentally handicapped persons, etc. Lastly, M explains why some morally defensible actions among informed and unimpaired adults are outlawed; for example, many think selling/consuming hard drugs should be outlawed, not because such actions are inherently morally indefensible, but because it is believed that allowing hard drug sales/usage will significantly harm the greater society (e.g. rampant crime, decreased productivity, etc). \n\n* M explains why certain actions are legal. When neither conditions (a), (b) or (c) of M is met with regard to an action, people usually agree that it is morally indefensible to forcefully prevent the action in question. This is part of the rationale for the growing acceptance of legalized gay marriage and marijuana: newer generations no longer see gay marriage and/or smoking marijuana as morally indefensible, nor do they see them as significantly harming the lives of others. Gay marriage, for example, is being recognized as a morally defensible consensual interaction between two informed and unimpaired adults that does not significantly harm the lives of others (*at least not in the right way* - see above), thus it doesn't meet conditions (a), (b) or (c) and should not be illegal. \n\n* I believe that M (or something like M) is implicit in the vast majority of reasonably educated persons with generally accepted moral beliefs. The reason I believe this is (roughly) because if you did not believe this, then you would have to accept that it might be morally defensible for some outside party to forcefully prevent you from performing an action, even though the action is neither morally indefensible nor significantly harmful to the outside party's life, and even though you are unimpaired and are reasonably informed about the consequences of the action. But surely you and most others would agree that such prevention is almost always a morally indefensible violation of freedom? Because of this and the previous two bullet-points, I believe that moral claim M is widely established/accepted, since it can explain why we think certain uses of force are morally indefensible and why others are morally defensible.\n\nIf I am right that moral claim M actually is established/accepted, and if abortion is morally defensible as you say, then it follows that the pro-life position is morally indefensible, at least as it applies to abortion when the mother and doctor are unimpaired and fully informed. The reason is because, even if you grant that a fetus is a person, neither condition (a) nor (b) nor (c) of M is met: \n\n* I'm just going to grant that condition (a) of M is not met because you have already admitted that abortions are morally defensible in your OP. That is, it cannot be shown to be a condemned moral action according to basic established/accepted moral values upon which there is a wide consensus. \n\n* Condition (b) of M is not met because I'm restricting the discussion to abortion where the mother and doctor are fully informed and unimpaired enough to properly give consent.\n\n* Condition (c) of M is also not met because abortions are interactions between a mother, a fetus and potentially a doctor. These interactions do not significantly harm the lives of people outside of this group, at least not *in the right way*. That is, there may be people outside of this group that are upset that abortions occur, but this does not mean that their lives are significantly harmed enough to warrant outlawing abortion, because (as shown earlier): *merely being upset with certain actions does not justify forcefully preventing such actions*. \n\nHere's a quick summary sketch of my argument and why it follows that the pro-life position is morally indefensible:\n\n1. [Argued for, above] Moral claim M is generally established/accepted. That is, it is generally established/accepted that: it is morally indefensible for group X to forcefully prevent actions among members of group Y unless either (a) such actions are inherently morally indefensible, (b) the agents in group Y performing the actions are too uninformed/impaired to properly give consent or (c) not preventing such interactions will significantly harm the lives of those in group X. \n2. [You accept in your OP] Abortion is morally defensible. \n3. [Argued for, above] Abortions are actions that involve a mother, a fetus and potentially a doctor. Allowing abortions does not significantly harm the lives of people outside of this group, at least not *in the right way*.\n4. [from 1, 2 &amp; 3] Using generally established/accepted moral claims: it is morally indefensible for people other than the mother, fetus and/or doctor to prevent an abortion (at least when the mother and/or doctor are informed/unimpaired enough to properly give consent).\n5. [Using the definition in your OP] The pro-life position asserts that abortion should not be allowed (at least under typical circumstances), which means that people other than the mother, fetus and/or doctor should prevent abortions even when the mother and/or doctor are informed/unimpaired enough to give consent.\n6. [from 4 &amp; 5] Using generally established/accepted claims: the pro-life position is morally indefensible. \n\nThis argument seems roughly valid to me. Therefore, if you disagree with the conclusion, you must disagree with one of the premises. Since you have accepted premises 2 and 5 in your OP, you must then reject premise 1 or 3, which I have argued for above. If you disagree with one of these premises, then explain why and tell why my argument for the premise fails (one premise at a time, please).

We are discussing it as a society.  We are not discussing whether or not it is moral to have an abortion, or whether or not is moral to personally perform an abortion.  These are decisions made by individuals, but society is not an individual and thus has a different sort of decision to make and different arguments to consider.\n\nThe primary decision a society makes in this issue is whether or not to ban abortion using the rules and laws of that society.  The arguments for or against such a societal decision must be made on a societal level.\n\nThe primary consideration for a societal decision should be the maximization of the common good.  I would define that common good as \"having the social systems, institutions, and environments on which we all depend work in a manner that benefits all people.\"\n\nIt is through this justification that society gains its authority.  They set laws that are obeyed because doing so is better than not doing so.  Murder isn't illegal because it is personally immoral, it is illegal because it is socially beneficial not to live in a society where murderers are not punished.  When killing is beneficial to society, such as in the cases of war or taking down a violent criminal, it is allowed by the state.\n\nThe question then becomes a matter of objective good to the society, rather than of the personal morality of the action.  \n\nTo what extent is the practice of abortion beneficial or harmful to society, and how can that be defined?  To what extent would banning or partially banning abortion change how people actually behave?  If some abortion practices are beneficial and some are non-beneficial, what laws can be considered to prevent harm from the non-beneficial practices while permitting the beneficial practices?\n\nFirst, we must thoroughly define what is to be measured.  In this case, the best lens is to look at the health and well-being of a society while other measures of common good might instead focus on the economic benefit or some other analysis.  But this runs into the issue of determining the constituency of a society.  If the fetuses are considered a part of society, then surely abortions would be a large source of death and hurt public health and well-being.\n\nIn this case, we use definitions of utilitarianism and society to craft our analysis. A society is \"a group of people involved in persistent social interaction\" and the ethical theory we are using is utilitarianism, or that theory that states that the best action is the one that maximizes the well-being of sentient entities. \n\nFetuses in this case might be counted in terms of long-term analysis of a social group as potential functional members, but as fetuses they are neither involved in persistent social interaction nor can they be considered sentient at every form of development.  In this case fetuses that are aborted before sentience cannot possibly enter society.  \n\nNow, with one complicating factor we can analyze abortion through a purely empirical lens based on its impact to society (or more correctly, look at the impact of banning or legalizing the practice of abortion).  \n\nA legal ban on abortion leads to the practice of more unsafe abortions, not the total excision of the practice.  [Deaths due to unsafe abortion lead to 13% of all maternal deaths](http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/magnitude/en/), and most of these occur in countries that have [bans on the practice](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/newmapworldablaw.gif).  This is a cross-sectional viewpoint, if we instead look at the US as a longitudinal viewpoint we can see that the adoption of legalized abortion coincided with a [significant reduction in maternal deaths](http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/health_and_science/two_lives/2013/09/130906_TL_MaternalMortalityChart.png.CROP.article568-large.png), which is strong evidence that banning abortion would lead to more maternal deaths (particularly a total ban).\n\nThis Donohue\u2013Levitt hypothesis proposes that legal abortion reduces crime, a hypothesis backed by some empirical data but with major criticisms.  It is hard to definitively attribute lowered crime to a single source such as legalized abortion, as opposed to other factors like the ban on leaded gasoline, and the way crime fell is not suggestive of an impact of abortion on crime (it fell first and fastest among older individuals, while the hypothesis predicts a decrease mostly among the young).  So while this is a possible benefit, it is not currently possible to definitively claim because the data is not consistent or thorough enough.\n\nAbortion impacts the society financially.  Children become taxpayers, and new parents spend more money on healthcare/clothing/etc which is a boost to the economy.  This is a benefit to banning abortion.  However, in countries that have gone from legalized to banned abortion children from poorer families had worse educational and job market achievements after the ban.  \n\nThose that were aborted could have gone on to make scientific or cultural achievements that benefited society, but it could also have led to lower overall education and more resources taken for those with significant medical challenges, leading to less achievements.  Overall it is hard to make definitive economic statements for benefits or harms; from a raw standpoint money is likely lost to abortion but on a per capita basis it is possible abortion is a net positive.\n\nThrough a demographic viewpoint, banning abortion impacts the poor more than the rich.  The rich can continue to have abortions by getting the procedure done in an area where it is legal, and tend to have less financial need for an abortion.  This leads to increased inequality, which creates strife and unhappiness and is a definite harm.  \n\nLess concrete is the relationship between legalized abortion and social progress for women.  It is hard to attribute higher workforce participation rates, education rates, etc. to abortion when it's legalization coincided with other changes in laws and practices.  Some would even make the argument that those statistics come secondary to a women's personal satisfaction, which they might claim has empirically higher in \"traditional\" relationships.  So while there is some correlation between the onset of abortion and women's social and economic progress, it cannot be definitively stated to be caused by abortion and the benefit isn't unquestioned.\n\nUltimately, this is what I think the above tells us.\n\nFirst, that many of the benefits and harms attributed to abortion are correlative rather than causative, lacking the data to make a solid empirical proof of benefit or harm.\n\nSecond, that legalizing or criminalizing abortion does have some verifiable impacts.  Banning abortion leads to a rise in maternal deaths, and more births of medically nonviable or severely challenged children, as causing an increase of inequality (this is not economic, but rather means that the laws are not applied equally).  \n\nAllowing abortion reduces a countries overall economic output, and while I did not discuss it also leads to more teen pregnancies and births before marriage.  It can also lead to non-beneficial practices by a totalitarian state, such as forced abortions of minorities or undesirables.  On the other hand, it has the benefit of generally raising education and job prospects of children in poorer families.\n\nThis leads to the following statements:\n\n* Societies have more economic output with more citizens\n* Abortion laws primarily impact the poor\n* Banning abortion leads to an increase in maternal deaths\n* Bans on abortions for the mother's health or for nonviable pregnancies have no benefit\n* The aim of abortion, legal or illegal is to reduce maternal economic or physical problems \n\nThis leads me to the following conclusion:\n\nThe most beneficial and least harmful combination of laws covering abortion would be to:\n\n* Fund research into keeping aborted babies viable until birth after removal from the mother's womb to allow the society and mother's goals to align (removal personal distress + keep new citizen)\n* Allow for selective abortions of medically nonviable or those that would need lifelong care\n* Allow for abortions that would endanger the life of the mother\n* Allow for selective time-restricted abortions for medically viable fetuses\n* Fund abortion such that deaths and complications from abortion are minimized\n* Reduce selective abortions as much as possible through education, elimination of economic distress, and alternatives\n* Ban forced abortions or practices that deliberately target and increase the abortion of a certain group\n\nThese laws would be enacted to:\n\n* Reduce abortions as much as possible, as abortion leads to lowers gross economical output\n* Allow legal abortions, as banning abortion leads to maternal deaths and legal inequality\n* Try to find a solution that saves the lives of medically viable fetuses while still enabling the reduction of maternal distress\n\nI will note that aside from possibility of funding an artificial womb, these laws are very close to what we already have in the US and EU.  Thus, with some small changes I believe that the current status quo of \"legal, but minimal\" abortion is close to the most utilitarian solution to the problem.  Any approach that uses individual morality to determine the legality of abortion is likely to come up with a binary solution, either that abortion is absolutely wrong or right, either of which leads to lowered utility and less overall good to society.\n\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think one issue is this primarily deals with the morality of:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The action of abortion&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The choice of the mother to choose to abort&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The issue is that when we discuss abortion, we not discussing it through a personal lens.

On the other hand, it has the benefit of generally raising education and job prospects of children in poorer families.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This leads to the following statements:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Societies have more economic output with more citizens&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Abortion laws primarily impact the poor&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Banning abortion leads to an increase in maternal deaths&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bans on abortions for the mother&amp;#39;s health or for nonviable pregnancies have no benefit&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The aim of abortion, legal or illegal is to reduce maternal economic or physical problems &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This leads me to the following conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most beneficial and least harmful combination of laws covering abortion would be to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fund research into keeping aborted babies viable until birth after removal from the mother&amp;#39;s womb to allow the society and mother&amp;#39;s goals to align (removal personal distress + keep new citizen)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Allow for selective abortions of medically nonviable or those that would need lifelong care&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Allow for abortions that would endanger the life of the mother&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Allow for selective time-restricted abortions for medically viable fetuses&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fund abortion such that deaths and complications from abortion are minimized&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reduce selective abortions as much as possible through education, elimination of economic distress, and alternatives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ban forced abortions or practices that deliberately target and increase the abortion of a certain group&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These laws would be enacted to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reduce abortions as much as possible, as abortion leads to lowers gross economical output&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Allow legal abortions, as banning abortion leads to maternal deaths and legal inequality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Try to find a solution that saves the lives of medically viable fetuses while still enabling the reduction of maternal distress&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will note that aside from possibility of funding an artificial womb, these laws are very close to what we already have in the US and EU.  Thus, with some small changes I believe that the current status quo of &amp;quot;legal, but minimal&amp;quot; abortion is close to the most utilitarian solution to the problem.  Any approach that uses individual morality to determine the legality of abortion is likely to come up with a binary solution, either that abortion is absolutely wrong or right, either of which leads to lowered utility and less overall good to society.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc1udbn", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5m17gg/cmv_prochoice_and_prolife_stances_are_both/dc1udbn/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483683846.0, "author_flair_text": "1\u2206", "created_utc": 1483655046.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m17gg", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc10fw9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "skippygo", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5m17gg", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "My point is a rather simple one and doesn't really address much of your view, but I would argue that the fundamental problem with the pro-life vs pro-choice argument is that it is fundamentally based on opinion.\n\nThere are obviously very complex arguments to both sides but what it really boils down to in most cases is when does a foetus become a person?

I think you did a pretty good job of breaking this down and remaining fairly objective. I also agree with you to some degree that both are morally defensible, in that there is no objectively correct stance.\n\nHowever, with that being said, I think your breakdown, well, breaks down at a few points. And where I would \"disagree\" is that there are more problems with one than the other. While both might be defensible, one is arguably more than the other.\n\n&gt; **a.** It is wrong to force pregnancy and labor upon a person for no reason.\n\nThis I agree with. I think any reasonable person would. But it is problematic for a couple of reasons. The first is the \"for no reason\". What reason makes it acceptable to force pregnancy and labor upon a person? Second, and more importantly, being opposed to abortion is not an argument to force women into pregnancy and labor. Since you excluded the exceptions, it is a given that the woman was not raped and therefore made a choice that put her in this situation. Nobody is forcing her to be pregnant or to go into labor. It is a natural state based on a decision that was presumably made by her. (One might argue that if it was an accidental pregnancy then she arguably didn't put herself in that state, but it being an accident doesn't automatically shift responsibility to somebody else, does it...?)\n\nThe presumption of force being applied is due to the fact that there are sources of societal pressure for her to not exonerate herself from that state. But it is intellectually dishonest to conflate those two things. By that same reasoning, people suffering from anorexia are forced to eat because a) their body is in a state of malnourishment and b) society as a whole would argue that they have a disorder and are behaving incorrectly with the correct behavior being to eat.\n\nNow, that societal pressure (regarding pregnancy) usually has to do with the value placed on the life of the embryo or fetus and that leads to where things really break down: **3a** and **3b**.\n\nYou seem to have predicated this entire thing on that value judgement being dependent on an unquantifiable and ambiguous quality of \"personhood\" and its very nature, being unquantifiable and ambiguous. Unless I missed something. \n\nYou completely leave out arguments predicated on the value of life, period, especially human life. By this same reasoning it would be a morally defensible position to kill non-human animals, for example, because we aren't sure if they posses a quality of \"personhood\" comparable to that humans can posses. And that does happen to be a defensible position. But I wonder if you meant to make that implication.\n\nBut I can take that a step further. You define \"personhood\" based on a \"typical adult human\", which is at best problematic. What about human children? Personhood generally confers rights like those you mentioned by virtue of being a *person*, which is the default position for a human. There is no requirement to be an adult or a typical one. The concept, while ambiguous, also does not even strictly apply to humans. We are just the only examples of it that we know of. It's not unreasonable to imagine that if we ever met intelligent alien life, that we would have no problem assigning at least some value to it by virtue of being approximately \"human\". But the biggest issue is the part about adult or \"typical adult\". You completely leave out children and imply that since they are not adults, their personhood is in question, and therefore it could be arguably morally defensible to kill them.\n\nA common basis for a Pro Choice stance is that the embryo/fetus does not meet one, more or all of a set of requirements of being: alive/a life, human, in possession of a quality like personhood, etc. We've covered the third, which should also cover any similar concepts, but not the first two.\n\nThe first two are not so ambiguous, in fact, they are straight forward, even considering how difficult they might seem to be defined. Science may not have a comprehensive definition of life, but that is because it cannot define all requirements for life. That does not mean that there is no way to quantify or identify life. The embryo/fetus is unambiguously alive. It is a life. It is a discrete collection of cells undergoing cellular division according to a presumably normal programming encoded in a distinct and usually unique set of genetic information. It's not a gall. It's not a tumor. It's not some abnormality. It's not unexpected. It's not unexplained. It might start off more closely resembling something like a bacterial colony, protist or deep sea creature, but all of those things are alive. It also has human DNA. It is human. There are plenty of questions regarding the requirements and definition of that from a philosophical angle, but those don't undermine how we currently definite it from a scientific one: A thing that is alive and that has human DNA is a human. The amount of value bestowed by that quality is the crux of the matter. Some might base it on the philosophical implications, others might exclude those entirely. And it could be argued that the value is derived from the fact that any qualities, even if unknown or undecided, absent at one time would be present eventually if left alive; a human life is valuable because of its potential, not whatever qualities it possesses at any given time.\n\nThe point being, some Pro Choice stances focus on requirements related to personhood, and there is ambiguity there. Others try to provide clarity and solve that problem by asserting that the embryo/fetus should not be considered alive, a life or a human and those are scientifically invalid. Those people are just, plain, factually wrong. Nonetheless, that doesn't disqualify Pro Choice in general from being defensible. The people who are only concerned with personhood or who aren't concerned with the humanity of the embryo/fetus (i.e. they accept that it is alive and human but don't care for one reason or another) have stances based on the subjective value they place on those things. Those valuations can certainly be debated, but there is no absolute or objectively correct position (as opposed to the people denying life/humanity who could not possibly defend an argument based on an invalid claim).\n\nWhen you have somebody who says \"I approve of abortion because I don't care about killing a fetus because it would get in the way of me doing other stuff\" (extreme example, I know) then fair enough. I know where their priorities lie and appreciate the candor. I'm not sure it is fair for me to expect them to care more about that human life than I do about starving children in Africa that I'm not disrupting my own life to prevent from dying. But just because I might feel the need to withhold judgement does not mean I need to agree with the position.\n\nSo on the other hand, when you have a Pro Life stance based on (not that all necessarily are):\n- a default value assigned by virtue of being a scientifically recognized human life\n- the standard morally supported idea that by default terminating a human life is inherently undesirable\n- the implications of the above outweighs the convenience of the mother (\"convenience\" is appropriate because you excluded the exceptional cases)\n\nThen you get a stance based on accepted science and standard accepted morality, as opposed to one based on arbitrary beliefs regarding unquantifiable qualities. You basically have one that says \"Well, we don't know or don't care, so go ahead and kill it\" and one that says \"It's a human life, let's avoid killing it if at all possible, just like we are supposed to in general.\" Obviously those are over simplified, but in the end you have one that errors on the side of preservation of life, which seems safer and more reasonable and therefore, arguably more defensible.\n\nAnd I'm sure somebody will remark on me using exaggerated examples that might seem like they are villainizing the Pro Choice position, but that's because if you take away the ambiguity of the \"personhood\" debate, that is what you get, except that it's not really villainous. That is just imagined by a person who takes comfort in the ambiguity that seems gentler in contrast to a black and white, albeit perhaps cold, alternative.\n\n", "edited": 1483646168.0, "author_flair_css_class": "points ", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: I came here from &lt;a href=\"/r/bestof\"&gt;/r/bestof&lt;/a&gt;.

Pro-life people want to deny women the right to choose what happens to their bodies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being pro-choice isn&amp;#39;t necessarily being pro-abortion. We don&amp;#39;t want to force any decision on anyone, we just want the choice to be there. Pro-life people do want to force a particular decision on all women. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you add in the fact that countries without a free public health care system like America will charge women for doctors appointments and hospital care while pregnant, the 9 months leading up to birth can become incredibly expensive for people without health insurance. Pro-life people aren&amp;#39;t just forcing a woman to be pregnant against her will, they are forcing her to spend money when she doesn&amp;#39;t want or need to otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "changemyview", "name": "t1_dc0jqth", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/5m17gg/cmv_prochoice_and_prolife_stances_are_both/dc0jqth/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483611702.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483582902.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m17gg", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5m17gg", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc2dypr", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Exacting", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc0f0mu", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "&gt; The correct answer seems to be to avoid pregnancies in the first place with contraception, preventing the life ending decision from ever taking place in most cases, then allow choice on the mother's end if contraception fails.\n\nI do not see this as significantly different from a pro-choice position + support of education/contraception.
