I separated from the Navy almost two years ago with an honorable discharge at the completion of my contract.  I spent three years in Japan during the Fukushima Incident, where I also had three back to back deployments.  Then came back to the US and got married, a month later was on deployment to the middle east for two consecutive deployments.  Those were considered &amp;quot;combat zone&amp;quot; so I am categorized as a &amp;quot;combat veteran&amp;quot; though I never actually performed any hand to hand combat.  I just worked in extreme heat conditions with no relief of stress, and as stress built up in me, I didn&amp;#39;t handle it appropriately.  I passed out from heat exhaustion a handful of times; only one time was actually reported in which the experience was so embarrassing and uncomfortable I don&amp;#39;t feel like explaining it, but i was rediculed for it really badly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After getting back to the states, I married and deployed, the home life was difficult because my finances weren&amp;#39;t in order before leaving which created stress with the wife.  The wife comes to find out was pregnant at that time.  The massive stress loads of her husband leaving, being in a position where we could communicate once weekly, my calls only stressed her more telling her that I witnessed sexual assaults, that I was being harassed by my chain of command for creating &amp;quot;problems&amp;quot; for them by blowing the whistle.  She ended up having a miscarriage.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I had no one to talk to about my issues because she wasn&amp;#39;t there and telling her about it only stressed her out more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to the chaplain to tell him what was happening.  He was assured by my chain of command that I was the problem and not the other way around.  Who do I talk to at this point, the Command Equal Opportunity Officer (e-7) who basically says she will look into it but doesn&amp;#39;t seem concerned.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a stigma about asking for help in the Navy and it needs to change.  Basically, if you take any meds you get treated like a black sheep.  If you go to medical and they give you meds, you get removed from your duties and everyone else carries your load while you are forced to stand around them not allowed to do anything.  If you do get out of the navy because you spoke out about being depressed, anxious, or having symptoms of PTSD then you would be seperated from the Navy and sent home.  This was referred to as &amp;quot;sadding out&amp;quot;.  I am not a quiter, I signed a contract and was monetarily tied up because they gave me a re-enlistment bonus.  If I complained, they wrote &amp;quot;written lawful letters&amp;quot; and made us sign page 13s (statements) saying that if we were to &amp;quot;sad out&amp;quot; then we would be responsible for paying back the entirety of our bonus before taxes which really meant about an extra 15k more than they paid me.  This scared the living shit out of me because I don&amp;#39;t want to let my wife or family back home down.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was being bullied hard by my chain of command, 2am calls to the deptartment heads office after a 40 hour work day and 45 minutes of rest just to be yelled at to the point I&amp;#39;m trembling with fear, crying, and feel like I am worthless.  Rinse and repeat for months on end.  This seemed like normal Navy life.  &amp;quot;Living the dream&amp;quot; they called it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I go to the pysch-o (pysch officer) because my wife convinced me that I needed to talk to someone.  I didn&amp;#39;t want to be seen going into the Psycho&amp;#39;s office, which by the way should not be located directly next to your work space.  The intentional design to have medical and psychological lines in walk ways right next to your work space is a complete violation of all hepa rights.  Out of fear of someone I worked with noticing me talking to the pyscho&amp;#39;s office I tried to ask him to meet with me regularly in private someplace that wasn&amp;#39;t labled &amp;quot;pysch officer&amp;#39;s office&amp;quot;.  Again, the stigma of sadding out is real and strong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Pyscho doesn&amp;#39;t want to prescribe anything or help me in any way.  No follow up, just tells me to go talk to an e-5 in a closet of an office directly connected through the pyscho&amp;#39;s office.  He began teaching me &amp;quot;breathing exercizes to use&amp;quot; while I was experiencing a panic attack.  I remember this experience well because we were in very close quarters and his breath stunk.  I decided at that point that this was not going to help and I wanted nothing more to do with this.  So I just started bottling everything up as best I could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bottling up was working for a while but I had a kid on the way, was getting out of the Navy, applying for jobs like it was my job,  and interviewing, moving, work repeat.  No time for relaxation, that will happen after the kid gets here.  I start scaring myself while driving because I would space out for long periods and just end up on the other side of town or have to pull over because I was having a panic attack or I would be falling alseep at the wheel from pure physical exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was driving my kid home from day care after getting off work and I late breaked almost ran into the car in front of me because I was so mentally checked out.  I decided I wouldn&amp;#39;t drive anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I immediately sought help from a private doctor while on terminal leave and went to the military docs to make sure it was documented on my medical record including a trip to the ER about panic attacks I was having.  I was placed on a SSRI (lexapro) with the initial diagnosis of a &amp;quot;chronic adjustment disorder&amp;quot; basically meaning I didn&amp;#39;t handle the change of getting out well.  Then I started to get really depressed, bored and avoided doing about everything I enjoyed.  I shut down.  I believe my wife noticed and had me moved to a new city where she could make more money, where pot is legal, and I could stay at home to avoid driving, going to work, or basically interacting with the rest of the world.  I have been concerned about the sexual side effects of the meds I had been on because my wife wanted to have another kid.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went 2 weeks of no panic attacks for the first time since the whistle blowing/miscarriage/dog bite/boss fired from job for fucking his boss/emminent war/etc deployment.  I then decided it was best to decrease my meds to a lower dose.  &amp;quot;Not being productive because it takes 2 hours to ejaculate is causing my problems&amp;quot;, I thought.  These are side effects of my medications. This is where things went bad...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started to get depressed but was personally unaware.  My wife started to notice that I wasn&amp;#39;t eating, was moody, not sleeping, and laying in bed all day.  She asked me if I was ok and I... broke down.  All emotions came to a tipping point and I started whaling in tears.  I told her I had been thinking about suicide.  I told her that I didn&amp;#39;t feel like life was worth living.  She made me go to the VA and talk to a Doc.  I think they are evaluating me for PTSD.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have yet to give me a diagnosis but were pretty dead set on asking me questions about my upbringing.  I feel like the VA treatment plans are designed to make it sound like the things you are experiencing were caused by something in your childhood so they don&amp;#39;t have to compensate you or something.  I don&amp;#39;t care about compensations but I cant hold a job for health care so I go to the VA.  Like, &amp;quot;we are here to make sure the military is not blamed for what ever is wrong with you&amp;quot; kind of thing in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I felt I should share some of the basic symptoms I have struggled with and the only treatment I have found that really worked is smoking indica strain cannibis at night when the child is asleep and having some relaxing time with my pets.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are my symptoms: \nPanic attacks\nsevere avoidance\nconfusion when trying to get off medication, confusion when going on medication\nStuttering / Stammering with increased frequency and severity.\nepisodes of extreme emotion (getting upset about the small things, irratablility)\nnight sweats (bed stinks so bad and I have to wash the sheets daily and my bedroom is 68 degrees and I only sleep with sheets.)\nnight terrors (re-occuring dream: waking up with the feeling that I am supposed to tell someone something to prevent an awful occurrence from happening but unable to say the words.
