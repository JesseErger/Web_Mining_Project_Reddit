I don&amp;#39;t want to dissect which triggers are the worst--whether that be walking down a certain block or seeing someone that walks with a gait like his or smelling a cologne similar to his. I am just so desperate to repress these things. I don&amp;#39;t want to think about it. I just want to move on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with these traumas for almost 8 years now and they&amp;#39;ve only increased due to age and mental illness and unfortunate situations. I&amp;#39;m trying so hard to be successful and live up to my potential and seize the opportunities given to me. But I constantly feel stuck in the past. And I&amp;#39;m really hurting.

I'm honestly the most stable I've ever been and it's a little scary, but it's nice. I'm hoping that after this month's I'll be more leveled out on the prazosin and will know my body/mind's response a little better. \n\nThankfully my schoolwork has definitely helped me a lot. I've begun to normalize my experiences a bit more and understand the way stress affects people. Coping strategies have come up a few times and I've definitely taken diligent notes lol. It's also great that a lot of the people I know in my program also suffer with mental illness because it's become a non-judging community. I've really found a home there. \n\nWhen it comes to letting the thoughts pass, I've gotten really good! This med has actually allowed me to do that for the first time. I spent these last two weeks with my partner and I had quite a few times where I sensed a trigger and all I did was speak on it real quick and let it pass. \"I smell someone that smells like he does, and like his bedroom did, and I'm controlling it. I feel horrible but we have stuff to do. It'll pass.\" And for sure, it did. It's amazing. I honestly haven't felt that before. I will try to take some emotion out of the memories though--sometimes I make lists of the abusive things my ex did so I can lay them out on paper and put them in order and just see them as words. That helps. Just need to maybe do some long-form writing on them now. \n\nThe loneliness seems like such a big hurdle but you're right, I know I can rely on my partner in tough times. I always have, and he's helped me through a lot, but since it's so personal it's a matter of finding a way to communicate without being explicit. Maybe that can help me almost normalize my experience and sort of not re-traumatize myself? And this sub really seems welcoming. It felt freeing to post here. I think I'll do it more on bad nights, and really good days :) \n\nAnd yes!!! You're right!!! I'm so afraid of asking for help or taking time outs because I'm so hard headed. I'm a terrible perfectionist and it ruins my life sometimes and never allows me to seek help. I can't just give myself a break sometimes. But like I said, I need to literally work it into my schedule. It's hard to accept that I'm not a machine that can constantly produce work. \n\nI realized that my professors are actually pretty sensitive to my issues this last semester when a seriously close-to-home trigger came up in class and I heavily disconnected for 45 mins and had to eventually leave the class. I didn't inform the professor right then but they emailed me the day after and said they noticed what happened the previous night. I lightly explained my PTSD and they were more understanding than I could have imagined. I also have an amazing research sponsor that I know is willing to help me. You're right.

It can be hard, especially when you feel so pressured by academics, but it&amp;#39;s worth it.  And if you need to contact professors and ask for an extension or help, it&amp;#39;s okay.  I was so scared when I first approached a professor about not being able to do something because of my anxiety, but I was shocked how understanding she was - how understanding they all were.  I&amp;#39;m not sure if this is something you need to do or not, but please remember that there are many people out there who do care about you.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "ptsd", "name": "t1_dc4dq4k", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ptsd/comments/5mjme1/very_long_venting_post_ahead_new_medications/dc4dq4k/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483835821.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483807021.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ptsd", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm0x", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mjme1", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": null, "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm0x", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mjme1", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": null, "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm0x", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5mjme1", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc4oqpy", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Coffeecupgripp", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dc4nkus", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "It is very hard to listen to yourself.
