To make a long story short (I&amp;#39;ve got my story posted somewhere so if it helps I can find it) I was a victim of a home invasion while on vacation with 15 of my friends, one of my childhood friends ended up shooting the intruder in the head and killing the man. Myself and one other childhood friend was right in front of it when it happened. The problem(s) I&amp;#39;m facing now is this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was 23 at the time, I was fit, in shape (or getting there, finally skinny for the first time in my life) I was extremely sociable, I need to repeat that for emphasis, EXTREMELY sociable, it was my biggest strength, it was my identity, it was how I made my money. Nobody I couldn&amp;#39;t talk to and no shortage of confidence. I was jovial, too. Always the optimistic guy with the ideas for the next new thing ambition and drive overflowing out of me I strived to be liked by as many people as I could. I had a plan for my future and a girl, so many new and exciting things in my life and I was genuinely happy. Without going into my life story and being dramatic I was very rich in my relationships and I knew exactly who I was as an individual to put it simply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now, 3 years later and none of these things about me are true anymore. I have random spouts of social anxiety, I&amp;#39;ve lost my sex drive and broke up with the girl I was with, I have no motivation at all, about anything. I stopped caring about if people like me or not, I just turned into a cynical asshole, and stopped caring about people all together if I&amp;#39;m being brutally honest. If I don&amp;#39;t absolutely have to talk to you in a day then I won&amp;#39;t, that includes family, friends, pretty girls I sit next to in class, house mates, all of them. Even if I do have to talk to you to make a dentist appointment or regularly day stuff often times I won&amp;#39;t because... I don&amp;#39;t know, whats the point anymore? Substance abuse at an alarming rate, booze, weed, adderall, lsd, shrooms, whatever. I&amp;#39;ve gained ~80 pounds, heaviest I&amp;#39;ve ever been (but I couldn&amp;#39;t care less), I have nightmares about all sorts of things, I&amp;#39;ve got no ambition or drive anymore and the only thing I got going for me is my job, I have that which is oddly enough a sales job. I put on a fake smile for 8 hours and do the bare minimum, just so i don&amp;#39;t get fired and I have enough money to buy all the self destructive substances I like so much. I could make 6 figured if I put my mind into it, I know I used to have the skills and ambition but not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now there has been very little turmoil in my life outside of that incident, I&amp;#39;m fortunate enough to have an extremely loving family, friends that still talk to me and the reason I tell you this is because for the life of me, I can&amp;#39;t understand what happened.
