Can they do it for you? Like If I bring a charger? It also says you can bring a cd player with speakers, but again how would you charge the speaker? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as art, what kind of things can I bring? Colored pencils? Crayons?

Also, are underwire bras allowed? I know you can&amp;#39;t have stretchy clothes, which is fine, but I&amp;#39;m not sure if sweatpants will be too hot for everyday wear?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It says I need to bring calling cards for long distance calls, how many minutes would be good for a month long stay? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what else to ask, I think those were the major ones.
