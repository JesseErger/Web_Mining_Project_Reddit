As a child you're just learning how to process feelings and, therefore don't have a great handle on them. Your sibling calls you a name, you're throwing things. You fall down, you're in tears. You get that present you really wanted for Christmas, you're running around the house screaming. Obviously with different ages comes different severity of this but same principle. You're still learning how emotions work and really only dealing with the simple ones: anger, sadness, happiness, crankiness, etc. When a sexual trauma is thrown into the mix, it forces a child to process adult emotions they aren't ready for yet: Violation, betrayal, distrust, hurt, confusion. These are very complex emotions that even grown adults struggle with. For a child it is devastating. And, children have a tendency to go numb when faced with emotions they just can't even begin to wrap their heads around. It's possible that when this was happening to you as a kid it didn't seem like a big deal because you don't remember being upset about it at the time. Because you would have expected to have felt these strong adult emotions about it when you didn't even have access to them yet. \n\nI think one of the big steps you are going to have to take is to not downplay the childhood sexual abuse. It's a terrible, horrible thing to happen to you during a time of your life when you were very vulnerable. And, it wasn't okay. He wasn't okay. Nothing about the situation was okay. And, it's okay to not feel okay about that. What helped me to validate my own sexual abuse was imagining doing what was done to me to somebody else. I was drugged so I would imagine having sex with somebody who was completely drunk while I was sober. It feels horribly wrong and even the thought makes me feel guilty. I don't know the details of your situation but even the thought of sexualizing a child should make you uncomfortable. Let alone taking any action on it. It's a really, really hard realization to make but once you can say, \"Okay, that was fucked up\" you can start processing those feeling you didn't when you were younger.  I'm also an anxious disaster and once you start processing and laying those feeling to rest you're going to start feeling that anxiety lifting too. Not that it ever goes away but the severity definitely goes down. \n\nI would definitely try to get yourself back in therapy if it is ever an option again in the future.

I actually use the principles of a branch of psychotherapy to guide my life. It's called [logotherapy](http://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/logotherapy) and is based on healing a patient through finding their meaning. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiM5a-vaNkg&amp;t=187s) is a super accessible way understand it's use and relation to trauma. Even if your mix of OCD and PTSD make it hard to function (which what a combo, you deserve a medal) you have to not only find meaning in your struggles. Even if it is as simple as, my anxiety has led me to be more understanding of people with mental illnesses then, there you go, you just put a positive spin on a horrible situation. It's going to make the pain more bearable when you're working through some of the ugly memories. In addition to that, in order to be happy you are going to have to continuously feed what drives you. If you love exercising, do it. Even if walking down your street is all you can manage that day. If you're artistic, doodle in a notebook. If you love to learn, then watch some youtube videos on something new. The only way you're going to keep your mental sanity through all of this is to have passion. To have a you outside of your mental illnesses. \n\nYou are reaching out for help not only in therapy but on here which shows so many amazing things about you. It's obvious you want to get better and are willing to put the work in to do it. And, because of that I really see you being successful. And, if you already have OCD and a shred of mental sanity, then you are already stronger than you know. I had OCD when I was a kid and it's a bitch. So, you really are amazing. You're going to do great and you seem like a very sweet girl. Just take things day by day. You don't need to be running any marathons tomorrow. Take your time and don't stress about it. It's a process. When you have a bad day, let it roll over you like a wave. When you have a good day rejoyce on your progress. I've had crippling PTSD and am now in the best place I have ever been in my entire life. If I can do it then you can to. You're going to do great.

Take your time and don&amp;#39;t stress about it. It&amp;#39;s a process. When you have a bad day, let it roll over you like a wave. When you have a good day rejoyce on your progress. I&amp;#39;ve had crippling PTSD and am now in the best place I have ever been in my entire life. If I can do it then you can to. You&amp;#39;re going to do great.

Something else may happened but I don't remember. But I was never bothered by it at all. \n\nAnyway a couple of years ago as an adult I was triggered by something specific and then a year later again by something else similar (both was horrible, upsetting and scary to me anyway but not fitting for PTSD) and I didn't understand what was happening and thought I was just reacting to the current situations. Now I see some specifics from both which could reminded me of what happened when I a child. Mainly both involving a creepy man who I didn't like who reminded me of the old man when I was a child in both their character and appearance etc. (and other things too like what was happening, i won't go into detail, and the environment and felt kinda trapped).\n\nSo at the time of those triggers was the only time I'd say I *knew* it was a flashback like how you describe maybe? I felt those emotions like what I described that I guess I had suppressed from when I was a child. And I could describe it felt like the walls were closing in and I was about to explode or implode (I mean I didnt actually think or literally but just that's the only way I can sort of describe it) and I just felt trapped, helpless etc. and an overwhelming desire to get away. One time just felt sort of out of it afterward etc. as I got out the house and walked away. The other time I was crying afterwards. \n\nI never thought to compare those times to a panic attacks but now I can see some resemblance maybe. But panic attacks (i think they are) aren't so bad for me (sorry I know that sounds weird to say) and  I only get them over things like an a relationship ending badly and it felt like drowning in fear but not connected to anything particular and I only had them a couple of times ever. But I think maybe I see what you mean with that description.\n\n Anyway after those triggers I mentioned where it could a flashback is when I could possibly have developed PTSD symptoms for maybe a year or so afterward at least (I'm not like that anymore, well I still have OCD, which includes intrusive thoughts just from that, and avoidance of certain things, but I'm now more affected by maybe something like CPTSD from emotional abuse if that's possible?). Anyway back at that time I had nearly constant intrusive thoughts (plus I have OCD which only became extreme and noticeable after I felt traumatised by the triggers. And I still have it kinda badly now but not as bad like before as that was different in general then I think). And some other symptoms I think. Anyway some occasions I'm not sure if it would have been a particular heightened intrusive thought or a mild flashback if that makes sense? For example when having sex with my boyfriend I often had to stop as I was associating it with the horrible men (from the 'triggers' who were like the man who abused me) and like it was him and replaying the 'trigger' in my head. \n\nI think my therapist was going to see if she could diagnose me (but then I had to stop as I couldn't afford) but I think it was more like she just said it could be PTSD after I told her what happened as a child and we made the connection to everything I had been talking about before and I asked her. But I only saw her for 4 sessions. \n\nSorry for the long reply I didn't know where to write this.
