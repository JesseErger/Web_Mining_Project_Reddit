What the argument was about, I have no recollection, but what followed I will never forget. The school bell had rang and we were quite far out on the field to one side near an overgrown fence. He tried to hit me, but I was doing well enough at protecting myself. He got angrier, and soon enough his hands were on my shirt collar like a movie bully trope come to life. However, instead of pinning me to a wall, he let go and put his hands around my neck. The next moments went on for what felt like forever. He pushed his thumbs down. I grabbed his hands and tried to pry them off, but that wasn&amp;#39;t working at all. So I instead opted to grab him at the elbow and dig my nails into the inner side of his elbow (around where you get blood drawn). He kept up the pressure and I kept digging my nails into his flesh. My thoughts swirled in my head as we were locked in this struggle. I wondered why no one was coming to help, was he going to kill me? Eventually my vision started to fade and I started losing feeling in my hands and feet. My mind started to wander off to things other than my struggle for air, and one thought stuck with me &amp;quot;the sun is really bright and warm on my face.&amp;quot; With that thought, I closed my eyes tight and felt the strength starting to leave my arms. I felt my chest and abdomen twitching trying to expand and pull in air and I thought to myself, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to die. I don&amp;#39;t want to die.&amp;quot; Then, for whatever reason, he let go. He was crying and his arms had clear, deep marks where I had dug in my nails. I hoped the pain I caused him made him stop. He walked away as I collapsed to the ground coughing, crying, and swallowing all the air I could get. My vision started to become clear again, and the feeling in my arms and legs came back. I got up, went back to class, and carried on with my day as if nothing had happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Upon waking up to reliving this experience again I was left gasping for air and covering my throat with my hands. The feeling of not being able to breath persisted for quite a while (around 4 horrible hours), and I was left trembling and crying for the entire time.
