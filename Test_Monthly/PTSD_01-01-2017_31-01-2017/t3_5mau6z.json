I deeply disliked my job. Everyone had seen my resume or whatever. And everyone was passive aggressive. The manager tried to peg down my salary multiple times like a fucking haggler at a market.

What also upset me was the fucking fact that she tried to psychoanalyze me. And blamed my parents. She asked me what my mother did for a living, asked how old I was, and made a whole bunch of inappropriate comments. She also decided that what my mother did or how my parents are is why I am the way that I am. I am the way that I am because people in life are shit. People are abrasive and mean and stupid and they shit on each other all the time and are presumptive. Most people live alone. Blame your parents!

I loved the fact that while her mom was a psychologist she was a pathological liar and narcissist. My PTSD revolves around lying and being lied to at work or in a relationship. I have no qualms about anything else.
