to try natural medicine like DMT, MDMA, psilocybin Mushrooms,...\n\nThough I listened a lot to Terence Mckenna I never dared to touch anything that will let my mind free because I am always controlling forcing it to think so it stays busy so I don't remember.\n\nI took something called \"Truffles\" to test this theory and I have to tell you, it made me think and realize a lot of problems I never noticed.\n\nDon't get me wrong I cried the whole trip long but it was not so bad because I learned a lot.\n\nMy question is should I take something like DMT or MDMA even though I may have PTSD.\n\nThe reason I say \"may\" is because I don't know what I have.\n\nI have this weird problem I can't trust anything made by humans like Medicin or other stuff\n\nbecause I think society is ready to kill anyone for profit \n\nso I stick to weed to calm myself and just wait if I have a headache.\n\nWhen I try to take a pill I want to vomit really bad so I avoid it.\n\nThings like this make me think I am sick in the head and I'm fearing that it will get worse if I don't do something about it.\n\nBut that is not the only thing that bothers me.\n\nThe real thing is that society is so fucked up now I understand it.\n\nIt breaks my heart when I see a kid suffering from hunger or cold because I know how it feels.\n\nNot long ago I quit my job because I could not take it anymore.\n\nThis 8 hour system does not work for me.\n\nSo created an e-commerce site (www.Neromero.com) and I'm planning to change everything.\n\nIf by any chance my site has a lot of success and I'm rich I can honestly tell you all the money will go to building schools and places for the starving children because I don't care about money after all it is the reason why my life is so fucked up.\n\nAnd i have to tell you it feels so good to do something that matters.\n\nI use to wake up every morning feel sick and wanting to vomit.\n\nAfter i started working on the site it has reduced alot.\n\nSo what else is there i can do to make myself feel better.\n\nI feel that my life is just starting now and the past 23 years i never was born.\n\nIf you have any advice for me please let me know here.\n\nthanks\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "mod_note": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "saved": false, "id": "5lkqxt",

A good therapist will need to work with you over several years, not just a couple months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you feel the need to medicate yourself please see a psychiatrist. Drugs like MDMA are probably not helping you given your state of mind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you cannot find help there are some excellent books and websites about PTSD and trauma. I&amp;#39;m reading Healing Trauma by Peter Levine right now. Very good but challenging. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, find others you can talk to about this. Posting here is a good way to start. Maybe there&amp;#39;s a PTSD support group in your city? The more you know about the illness the better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "ptsd", "name": "t1_dbwsejm", "score_hidden": false, "permalink":
