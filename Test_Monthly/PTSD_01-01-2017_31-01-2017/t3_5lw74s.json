It&amp;#39;s kind of, sort of, a little bit like that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except maybe you were shocked really badly, or maybe shocked a lot over a long period of time, and now sometimes you get angry about it or depressed about it because it really sucked and it feels unfair that it happened. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or sometimes you&amp;#39;re out minding your own business, having a good day grocery shopping or whatever and then you see somebody&amp;#39;s hand and suddenly your heart rate goes up and you flashback to being shocked and all you want to do is leave the store and hide hide hide hide until you feel safe. Or maybe kick them or scream. But mostly hide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you&amp;#39;re sound asleep but wake up in a cold sweat with heart pounding for the third time that night and you desperately wish you could just fucking forget about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you have to go to work and everybody thinks handshakes are no big deal, so you try to act like it is no big deal, and logically you even know it is no big deal, but your body keeps reacting with strong fear responses like it is a BIG SCARY DEAL. Tight chest, racing heart, goosebumps, feelings of dread, trembling, sometimes more or less symptoms that may or may not be visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you try various medications, therapies, coping strategies, etc to try to get back to &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; so you don&amp;#39;t have excess stress after [aka post] a trauma... from your post traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t speak for everybody but that metaphor is about the best I can come up with. Just replace electric buzzer with situation(s) more physically and emotionally painful than anybody ever wants to experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "ptsd", "name": "t1_dbyy42j", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ptsd/comments/5lw74s/do_you_think_people_could_understand_ptsd_without/dbyy42j/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483524312.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483495512.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ptsd", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}]
