Keep in mind everyone has to find their own path. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;1 Don&amp;#39;t be the Victim just because you are one.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now complicated title but what this means is yes you got dealt a shitty fucking hand, and yes something terrible happened, and yes please please please address and deal with whatever the root cause of your PTSD however don&amp;#39;t wear the victim label on your forehead, do not make it part of your identity. You can be open about your PTSD and everything else but don&amp;#39;t make it your entire existence it will fucking end up consuming you. Own it, I own my PTSD like crazy because it makes me feel in control but the reality is the world will not kowtow to me, they will not always cater to my symptoms, triggers or anything else. The reality is, no one else&amp;#39;s problem but mine. So don&amp;#39;t expect waves of empathy, it sucks but it is not how humanity works. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;2 Not all mental health treatment is created equal.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What that means is what it says, get treatment, in fact never close off treatment. Even when you feel like you are 20 years down the line and you no long go to reg therapy have a therapists number somewhere in case you do it, and your coping skills taught are your new mantra, do them everyday like you breathe air without thinking. Now second thing, if you find therapy isn&amp;#39;t helping don&amp;#39;t be afraid to divorce your therapist, seriously they won&amp;#39;t take offense. If it&amp;#39;s not a good fit, it&amp;#39;s not a good fit..therapy won&amp;#39;t work if you are butting heads with your medical team. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;3 Therapy Should Hurt but not cause harm.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the title says, therapy should fucking hurt, it should be emotionally exhausting it should feel like work, because it is work. Think of it like the gym, working out hurts like hell at first...then you get used to it, then you up the ante and add more weight or a harder routine, guess what it hurts again..therapy is the same thing. Good therapists are not there to just be sounding boards (while they are there for that function too) they are there to help you get your fucking mental health in order to the best it can be. Which means put in the work, guess what it might hurt like hell, you might have a panic attack, you might cry but guess what that little bit of hell might be a huge light at the end of the tunnel. Now if your therapist is an emotionally damaging asshat without cause thy need to go, but will your therapist upset you..fuck yes they will...your therapist is not there to baby you..good ones will not abuse you but they will spell it out and they will tell you the cold hard truth. Why because sugar coating does more harm then good. My therapist and I have a huge love hate relationship, I love the guy for the care he provides and the difference he has made me work for, but damn to I hate going to therapy every week. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;4 Meds/Therapy are not a cure all.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as it says, these things do not ensure that you will never have symptoms, you may always have symptoms and you may always have to deal with them. These things dampen those symptoms down to manageable, and teach you coping skills but does not mean you will feel like you did before..you may never again..hard truth but again nothing wrong with it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;5 Find an outlet&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And by that I mean a healthy one, hell find multiple outlets the more the better. If you can work, do so as well as find hobbies, or activities you enjoy, even if it&amp;#39;s something small and again if possible do one of those things everyday, like it&amp;#39;s second nature because it gives you something else, it decompresses. If you can&amp;#39;t work hobbies are important and allows you to keep ties and forces you not to isolate from the rest of the world...isolation is dangerous and it&amp;#39;s what the demons as I call them want you to happen. The brain is trying to protect itself but you can&amp;#39;t let it just rule you, you can tell it brain that is great but guess what I appreciate it, but we are going to go and do this cause I think you are wrong. Basically folks its not healthy to live in a fucking bubble if you can avoid it..do not do it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;6 The old you may be as good as dead, accept it.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sick way of saying it but it&amp;#39;s the reality. Every once in awhile I catch my symptoms as they are going on, almost in a third party manner, and go wtf is wrong with me, and then oh I go oh yeah..fuck. This was and is still the biggest hurdle and thorn for me, is accepting that life is totally different in many aspects and many aspects the geological-tech I was before is fucking dead. All the things that I used to do, lots of them now are just a total struggle, and all the things I could just do without think about it. Now I stand in line at the airport for example and I am having nearly full blown panic attack because the sheer amount of people around me. I went from a fairly normal healthy adult with a clean mental profile, no major medical issues, who was fucking fearless..and now I have the classic symptoms of hyper vigilance, panic attacks, startle response..I mean come on I don&amp;#39;t need to list them off we all know the deal. The reality is that I have to accept that at this stage in the game (I got my ptsd label Dec 2015) that the ptsd is no longer acute it is chronic which means the old me is dead, that fearless human being will never exist in the same manner. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which means what? Means I have to kick the shit out of the new me, put in the work and get myself to a place where new me is as close as the old me as possible, I will always have the trauma, scars, maybe the symptoms but doesn&amp;#39;t mean I can&amp;#39;t live...will just take some work...refer back to therapist. The reality is acceptance is a huge step in moving forward in any treatment, thing of AA and the whole 12 steps first is admitting your an alcoholic because denial will not help SHIT. It will make you resistant to treatment, and all kinds of things.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;7 Develop a Vice...I recommend a healthy one.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Develop an addiction..and no not a drug/drinking addiction (the white coats give us as enough meds...don&amp;#39;t seek out more) but you have have health immoral habits, if binge watching tv is your thing, eating an entire cake to yourself, buying expensive tabletop games, whatever. DO IT, don&amp;#39;t do it everyday but set some time once a month, twice a year, every few months depending on your vice and exercise it. I often say everyone needs a vice and it&amp;#39;s true, I have a few..they are pressure relief valves, and you know what they make me love and just appreciate life...and they are fucking purging. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;8 Be around living things.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Big one, introduce something else living into your environment, doesn&amp;#39;t have to be something wicked high maintenance like a dog. Get a plant with a zen garden, seriously science facts plants grow better when you talk to them, no I am not crazy. Seriously living things make you feel better, it&amp;#39;s something else other than you, and it gives you something to take care of other than yourself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;9 Take care of yourself&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which doesn&amp;#39;t mean you have to be an olympian and eat some crazy insane diet. It means you should do things everyday as simple as you need to get up, shower, do a hygiene routine aka shit, shower and shave, get dressed, and eat. Even if this is all you do for the entire day you have accomplished 4 things. Even better expand the list, aka the routine be that get the paper, walk dog, go to gym whatever works for you...and constantly expand it. PLAN YOUR DAY ENTIRE DAY, it sounds like a pain in the tail but when it comes to mental health ROUTINES ARE AWESOME, and they make a huge difference. They give you purpose, do not flounder it&amp;#39;s not good for your brain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;10 Talk about it.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yep, this one sucks, cause no one likes to discuss the stigma or they don&amp;#39;t like to discuss the shit going on in their head...guess what too bad. Bust the stigma, don&amp;#39;t whine but be frank, if you know or someone else that is struggling help the best you can, constantly let others know that yes they will not drown, there is a boat, and it fits way more than one person. The reality is the more you own and verbalize things, the more control you have over it and the less over you. Bottom line is busting the stigma, no one should feel like they are alone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So does my short little list work for everyone, totally not but I think it is a good reminder for people like myself..and hopefully someone else can take something away from it.
