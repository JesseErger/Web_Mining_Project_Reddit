I am exhausted. I am fed up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am sensitive to everything. Sometimes light and sound. Sometimes emotions and feelings. Sometimes situations. I feel like I am about to lose it any second.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am angry at the world. I am angry at myself. I am angry at everything and I fucking hate it. I am tired of all this rage &lt;em&gt;(talking from experience because I acted like some edgy teenager who knows nothing of the world and logic is thrown out of the window and I deeply regret it. Trust me, I wish that I never did it because I shouldn&amp;#39;t have acted that way. EVER)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;that anger that I mentioned happened as lately as a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deep down, I knew that something was off. I was not comfortable doing it. I never liked doing it but somehow, it felt that I had no other choice and felt that I cannot help it because for once, I felt like I wanted to just vent it all out and I couldn&amp;#39;t stop because I kept it all in for years&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always was a private person. I always liked solitude. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always preferred logic over emotion but my own traumas and twisted mind have slowly affected how I think for years and I deeply regret that I had to do such a thing as venting out like an angry teenager.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Much less so, I feel so angry and shameful that I didn&amp;#39;t try to get help or vent it off much earlier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like I wished I started to help myself when I was 18, or heck maybe even 16, but ... I was scared. I was unsure of myself. I was alone and I was full of confusion and bullshit to deal with at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may say that I have the excuse because I was a kid who did not fully develop yet and my traumas and also my anxiety and other mental disorders affected how I think while I was growing up &lt;em&gt;(not to mention, how it affected my brain development)&lt;/em&gt; but I still really regret that I did not help myself much earlier &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(if only anybody even listened to me or pushed me away or if only that family of mine even fucking treated me seriously instead of called me a freak, God I would be in a much, much better position right now instead of feeling regretful that I really did act like a freak or some butthurt Internet dim-witted idiot who doesn&amp;#39;t know any better and made an ass of myself)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot sleep. I cannot think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every day and every night is the exact same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wake up feeling miserable and I sleep feeling miserable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every day I wake up doing nothing. Absolutely nothing except wasting my life, hoping something would happen but of course nothing would happen because I am a lonely fuck who pushes away everyone in his life while everyone else goes out and party like there is no tomorrow and fuck and cum like they are in a porno and make memories that not even one memory book is enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every day I wake up doing nothing. Either wasting my time playing videogames or watching the social media status scrolling up and up and up when in reality, i am doing absolutely nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing is being absorbed in that stupid brain of mine, wherever the hell it is when I should be doing something more productive like studying or reading but either my own brain rotted to the size of a pea &lt;em&gt;(because of how mental disorders degenerate brain cells ... yay me, I am doing something at all)&lt;/em&gt; or it just felt and flew up to Mars, or it is sitting its dark throne,  rubbing its pitchfork,  planning its next move on how to fuck me, both literally and figuratively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I just wish I had the balls to get up from this fucking chair as if I have grown roots on it and get out and get some fresh air but then again ... where will I go?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(yay, mom ... you should be proud of me. I am actually someone who you called me as .. a lazy and miserable little fuck)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to be angry and furious but most times I can&amp;#39;t because I feel nothing and I keep it all in like trying to keep the lock shut of some cursed box. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I do get angry, I want to be as angry as a fucking goddamn maniac who should be chained and tied up in a straight jacket and the anger won&amp;#39;t go away like it just became my new drug&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walk and breathe like I feel like I am walking in an empty and dark room with no windows or no doors, no lights, no nothing and all I feel is this constant, slow and silent feeling of hopelessness and giving up-ness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other days, I walk and breathe as if I am walking in no man&amp;#39;s land. Fearing what I do or not do, afraid that even the next breathe or the next heartbeat might have an effect in something or cause something else. Fearing every step like it is going to be my last and some angry bitches are going to pounce on me and take me down or take me their slave barbecue that is what anxiety and fear does right? Make me a delusional psycho who cannot get rid of the fear like it is the end of the world? I fear that what I do in the future may cause a seriously huge fucking mistake that I can never get out of it. I feel little as if my problem is nothing, even a problem that is caused by a tiny microscope virus is more important than what is going on through my fucking head, or whatever chemicals and neurotransmitters in my body are making me feel, think and act.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am constantly feeling afraid. I am afraid of anything and everything at the same time&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am afraid of what happened or what may happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am afraid the world, the earth, the skies, the stars, aliens, humans, animals, whatever fucking bullshit thought that had occurred in my head that makes my skin crawl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am afraid of what I am or what I might become. I am afraid that I might go crazy or fight that I might become boring, or normal, or average, or weird, or some fucking hippie, or some fucking stupid hard-headed person. I am afraid that I might become too careless if I go to the &amp;quot;yolo&amp;quot; type of personality, or I become too much of a person who cares to much about anything. I am afraid that I don&amp;#39;t know the balance that I need to find where I should not care too little but not care too much either. I am afraid that people see me or not see me. I am afraid of judgement of whatever action or move I make or even thought occurs in my head. I am afraid that my mind is going to make as crazy as those lunatics that you see on television or psychological thrillers. I am afraid of becoming boring and normal but at the same time, I am afraid that I will not be in contact of my own head. I am afraid that I will become some sort of stereotype where I will push people away and be known like some kind of psycho on the internet. I am afraid of the world and it&amp;#39;s cruelty. I am afraid of what I am. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am afraid of fucking everything!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I try to keep reading plenty of motivational quotes during the day just so that I can have some more strength during the day and for fuck&amp;#39;s sake, it&amp;#39;s like these motivational speakers cannot get their shit together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Everything comes to you at the right time. Be patient and trust in the process&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; VS **&amp;quot;If you keep waiting for the right time, it may never happen. Sometimes you have to make the most of the time you have.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Time heals all wounds&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; VS &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;The wounds remain. In time, the mind, protecting its sanity, covers them with scar tissue and the pain lessens. But it is never gone.\u201d&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; VS &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Be careful with your words. Once they are said, they can be only forgiven, not forgotten&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh for God&amp;#39;s sake ... Make up your fucking minds!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyday I compare myself to others, I always reading to endlessly look for whatever the achievement or advantage they have compared to me and everyday I feel little, either I feel as little as a bug compared to a giant Titan or feel as little as one human fighting against a bloody war of a million people, a war that most of the time, I feel like I will lose eventually. I feel like I am stuck in some sort of Hunger Games setting or a setting of a post-apocalyptic world or a war zone type setting where my every step, my every breathe feels like I am being watched and every step feels as fucking stressful because it may or may not lead to absolute failure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyday, I feel so close to accepting my fate, that I deserve living in this silent and quiet yet still empty and agonizing piece of shit hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyday I feel empty. My mind, I cannot use it. I feel like I cannot process any data or information at all. I look at a book or a page or a letter and I feel like I am looking at a blank page or my mind is too stupid to even process whatever the hell I am trying to look or read. No wonder I get scolded for bad grades, called a lazy, worthless piece of fuck because I am too lazy or too stupid to care about exams and my future, but in reality, I deeply care too much as if I feel like the whole fucking world of 7 billion people, and millions or billions of other organisms are on my shoulders ... and all I can do is to shut down entirely. I shut down by brain, my thoughts, my emotions, everything because I cannot take all the anxiety. All the pressure. All the fear and terror.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel as depressed as if I am a lonely guy in a post-apocalyptic setting where everyone is either dead or absent or gone. I walk and sit and breathe as I am the loneliest guy on the planet and at the same time, I feel as scared as well because of the post-apocalyptic setting ... not sure who is out there or what dangers out there may come out and get me. Sometimes instead of a post-apocalyptic setting, I feel like I am stuck in some sort of prison that I cannot get out where the whole country or even the whole fucking world is a global size prison system, like some sort of Orwellian 1984 setting. All because everywhere I go, whatever advert or newspaper or newscast, I hear these common words silently screaming at me as if the people on the other end of the newscast are saying &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;DOOM!! HORROR!! THE WORLD IS ENDING!! NOT REALLY BUT WE WANT TO MAKE YOU FEEL THAT WAY BECAUSE THAT IS HOW THE NEWS WORKS AND IT PROFITS FROM YOUR FEAR AND TERROR AND ALL OTHER DRAMA AND SHOCK AND CONSPIRACIES THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH BECAUSE OF OUR AGENDA OR CLEVER PSYCHOLOGICAL TRICKS THAT WE HAVE LEARNED BECAUSE IT IS FUN FOR OUR SELF-RIGHTEOUS JOURNALISTS AND WRITERS WHO THINK THEY CAN TWIST THE WORDS ON THOSE MAGAZINES AND NEWSPAPERS TO TURN YOU INTO OUR LITTLE PUPPETS/SLAVES!! HAVE A NICE DAY AND TOMORROW WE WILL DO THE SAME THING, ONLY IN A DIFFERENT WAY, SETTING, THEME, AND A NEW SCAPEGOAT TO PUT THE BLAME ON! SEE YA!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I go on Facebook or other social media and see on the smiles and joyful faces that people post ... showing how great their lives are and how happy they are, making me feel more miserable than I already am when I look at the news feed at night on my bed while everyone else is partying or having a good time&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But eventually, every time, I notice that most of these are just fake smiles and fake social identities that we create for the public eye to see ... giving all those people around us that &lt;strong&gt;THEY&lt;/strong&gt; want to see, show that we show all our xoxoxo and all the hashtags and the inspirational quotes that we can find so that we show how gorgeous and beautiful our lives are so that we get that slight dosage of dopamine or to be sedated so that we want to escape that hard impossible game with the hardest videogame boss ever called life, so that we make our lives less boring or less miserable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Makes me wonder on how far people go to show off how great their lives are but in reality, whatever goes behind that screen may not always be the truth, whether or not their lives that they are trying to hide really are less interesting or miserable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I feel like my mind is screaming like it is a very vocal and toxic drill sergeant screaming on a fucking megaphone, sometimes it is a thousand voices whispering or screaming at once, sometimes it is all white noise, or sometimes it is not there - as if it just gave up and vanished and flew to the moon because it gave up trying to keep me alive and said &amp;quot;fuck it, you are on your own&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every day, I feel like I want to hurt or kill myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every day, I fantasize doing the most horrible thing to myself. Everyday when I look at the mirror, I feel like I want to break that ugly piece of shit face and smash it to the tiniest pieces until my own fists are full of blood and tiny pieces of glass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even if I don&amp;#39;t look myself in the mirror, even when I close my eyes, I picture myself as an ugly, unlikeable, horrible, piece of shit character that deserves whatever the fuck kind of shit is thrown at him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I mean that on a literal sense - physically, emotionally, psychologically, financially, economically, culturally - whatever you fucking name it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ask for professional help, and I will admit that I am thankful that I do. Maybe not all the professional help I was given was that helpful, probably because people have their own way of helping or maybe because we did not see eye to eye, but at least they tried but at least, I know what I am looking for in case I need some form of professional help. But I do only 1 hour in every 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to talk about all that has happened between those two weeks in just one hour. After the session is over, I feel good for a while, but then ... the pain comes back&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The silent whispering of an emotionally abusive devil talking to me. The silent sadness that you feel for no apparent reason yet somehow you feel too weak or too much of a pussy to do anything about it or even think that you deserve better because you feel like you deserve whatever painful feeling you are going through&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You feel like you rather suffer a long and painful life rather than ending your life because you feel like you deserve whatever agony you are going through&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The anxiety and panic attack come and go whenever they please.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it feels like you somehow been hit by an invisible truck and your body is as frozen as it somebody turned you into a popsicle and you have no other choice but shake from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you feel like your whole body is about to shake and erupt like a volcano or an earthquake but you have to keep it in, like trying to keep the lid closed in a highly pressurized gas container that is about to explode because you don&amp;#39;t want to make a scene, otherwise you are going to be ridiculed by your friends or your family because they look at you funny or say that you are crazy and deserve to be in a mental hospital.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or if this happens outside in a public area, you rather keep it all in and put on that happy smiley face like you always do so that nobody will look at you like you committed a crime or else people are going to tweet about this online and post photos and videos online and say &amp;quot;what a weirdo&amp;quot; or the media just loves to swim in the orgy of many they get for either making you look like that psycho guy/girl in the horror movies or like you use for their &amp;quot;pity campaign&amp;quot; making those with mental disorders appear less human need professional help as if they are people who are about to explode or they are people who have been supposed by the devil. And then you realize about the bunch of comments you get online.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You either find:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the trolls and sadistic psychopaths who like to LOL on your misery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the people who like to post &amp;quot;OMG, so sad&amp;quot; which basically does nothing else because apparently either they want to express their opinion about getting help but still wait for someone else to do it for them because they are either too lazy to do anything or don&amp;#39;t want their perfect lives to be compromised for being in contact with a psycho or they want to do it because they want to look pretty and helpful in front of their friends on social media because they like that good public image and that dose of dopamine they get from all the likes they get&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;those who act like they got a master&amp;#39;s degree in psychology, saying that we should do this or we should do that when in reality, they only watched a show on TLC &lt;em&gt;(which btw, I have told that no matter how real the characters are, they are mostly scripted and overly dramatized)&lt;/em&gt; or watched just one documentary &lt;em&gt;(only one, if it was real and accurate, anyway)&lt;/em&gt; and it is basically the most common and expected types of &amp;quot;advice&amp;quot; that we get like &amp;quot;think of the positive&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;but you appear normal, I didn&amp;#39;t know that you are mentally ill&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;you are ok, things will go better&amp;quot; and giving you whatever type of cheesy motivational speech they can come up with &lt;em&gt;(though you do eventually get some comments that are more helpful like people advising you some helpful comments of sympathy and warmth, or advice you some particular meditation type or some good relaxing music or some green tea because at least, it looks like they know what they are doing or want to give you help without being your doctor or your psychologist)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the kind of people who we are really looking for because they leave the most toxic comments ever. The people who just love to compare us to whatever type of fucking misery that exists in this god-forsaken, dirty, shitty, messy, fucked up world.&lt;em&gt;(in some cases, it is and it does look like it but it is not as fucked up as it was 10, 20 or even 50 years ago and thank God for it!)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;People have it worse than you&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Look at those soldiers in the Middle East. That is real bravery and suffering because you are just a civilian&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; or how about &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;There are people who are suffering through the pain of cancer and you are suffering because you feel sad?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; or I love this one &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;There are children out there who are dying of hunger. There are people out there who are living through war and tyranny and oppression. There are people out there who don&amp;#39;t have a job. They have it worse than you!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I am aware of that, asshole and I am sorry for those people too and I don&amp;#39;t give a shit because they have their shit and I have mine and I am on the unlucky side because those people get some sort of sympathy and help (sometimes) and all I get is some &amp;quot;get a grip&amp;quot; quotes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;those people who are all &amp;quot;tough love&amp;quot; because life is not fair or we should get a grip and press on or that this is all imaginary and it is all in my head. Yeah, I know, dumbass. Life is the biggest bitch and bully out there and it never leaves you alone. Yeah, I know that life is not fair but I don&amp;#39;t give a shit about how you managed to get a grip with your life. I appreciate your way of &amp;quot;helping&amp;quot; me but it doesn&amp;#39;t help. Now fuck off and mind your own fucking business&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And oh my god, my mind just fucking loves to humiliate me and torture me and make me like pussy ass bitch every single goddamn day because apparently I feel like I sold my soul to the devil at this point and I cannot do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it is those days of depression with all the days of emptiness and sadness&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it is those days of anxiety with all the panic attacks like it is the end of the world&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it is those days of PTSD with all the fear and horror you get like you are somehow transported into some horror movie setting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it comes in the form of suicidal tendency, like there is this invisible business man behind you, trying to sell you this  knife so that you can use it to stab it into your beating, soulless heart, or sometimes, it is just a barman with that wide selection of alcoholic beverages and whatever combination that us humans have managed to invent because fuck yeah, alcoholism makes all your problems go away and then it comes back again stronger and deeper than ever, with a bonus reward, a fucked up liver.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot sleep peacefully. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot spend my day without going through that piece of shit mind in an ongoing endless battle who is controlling who. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I smile to fake and fill up that empty feeling of sadness and numbness but it never worked but I cannot help it because I am tired and exhausted and sick and fed up of that feeling of numbness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I smile to fake that feeling like the world is about to explode so that I don&amp;#39;t look like an ass or a weirdo but I cannot help it because I do not wish to be treated as one as I was treated before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot study because my mind is too busy in other bullshit stuff that I wished I had figured out much earlier but they keep coming back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot eat without feeling with empty hole that needs to be filled yet it always ends up empty again. I cannot meet people or talk to people with having that smiley face again, sometimes I even over-emphasize my happiness by making jokes all the time and making an ass of myself. Sometimes I do as well to try to myself look funny so that I can get a date because I want to impress her as much as possible without showing her my real and genuine me because it might push her away on how I really feel inside&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I often say that it is too late to change or do anything about it so I rather just look at myself with contempt and disgust and see how much I fucked up &lt;em&gt;(and even then, I feel pity for feeling pity. I am angry for feeling angry not doing anything. And the cycle just seems to stay there and keeps going on and on and on and has been there probably for years at this point)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there, I am done with my rant.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I am sorry but I cannot keep holding on to this nonsense \n\nI am venting here so if you are a sensitive, then don't fucking read this post because this is not for the soft hearted. \n\nI am not expecting some sympathy or the most usual responses that I get on this sub-reddit that scream the words like \"me too\" or \"aww, you poor thing\" because that fucking never helps and I have given up finding help on this sub-reddit anyway because the way I am seeing it lately, it feels more like people who are whining on this sub-reddit so that they don't fear judgement or criticism from others who are ignorant or too stubborn or arrogant to know a fucking clue about how much depression silently aches personally *(both emotionally and even scientifically, as it has been scientifically proven that depression and other mental disorders are as painful as a \"normal\" or physical illness or injury but people are usually too damn arrogant or ignorant to even care or listen, or people are just too damn sensitive these days that even saying \"hello\" is now offensive to some people or when you try to get help, either people avoid you, either they help in their own way which never really does help at all, or who go with \"aww, you poor thing\" as if I am being pitied or dehumanized or ridiculed by my own \"disabilities\", or people who just too damn stupid to even know what depression really is and how painful it is - so fuck all of those people anyway)*\n\nSo I am just going to rant here\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nI am tired.

I cannot think.\n\nEvery day and every night is the exact same thing.\n\nI wake up feeling miserable and I sleep feeling miserable.\n\nEvery day I wake up doing nothing. Absolutely nothing except wasting my life, hoping something would happen but of course nothing would happen because I am a lonely fuck who pushes away everyone in his life while everyone else goes out and party like there is no tomorrow and fuck and cum like they are in a porno and make memories that not even one memory book is enough.\n\nEvery day I wake up doing nothing. Either wasting my time playing videogames or watching the social media status scrolling up and up and up when in reality, i am doing absolutely nothing.\n\nNothing is being absorbed in that stupid brain of mine, wherever the hell it is when I should be doing something more productive like studying or reading but either my own brain rotted to the size of a pea *(because of how mental disorders degenerate brain cells ... yay me, I am doing something at all)* or it just felt and flew up to Mars, or it is sitting its dark throne,  rubbing its pitchfork,  planning its next move on how to fuck me, both literally and figuratively.\n\nSometimes I just wish I had the balls to get up from this fucking chair as if I have grown roots on it and get out and get some fresh air but then again ... where will I go?\n\n*(yay, mom ... you should be proud of me. I am actually someone who you called me as .. a lazy and miserable little fuck)*\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nI want to be angry and furious but most times I can't because I feel nothing and I keep it all in like trying to keep the lock shut of some cursed box. \n\nSometimes when I do get angry, I want to be as angry as a fucking goddamn maniac who should be chained and tied up in a straight jacket and the anger won't go away like it just became my new drug\n\nI walk and breathe like I feel like I am walking in an empty and dark room with no windows or no doors, no lights, no nothing and all I feel is this constant, slow and silent feeling of hopelessness and giving up-ness.\n\nOther days, I walk and breathe as if I am walking in no man's land. Fearing what I do or not do, afraid that even the next breathe or the next heartbeat might have an effect in something or cause something else. Fearing every step like it is going to be my last and some angry bitches are going to pounce on me and take me down or take me their slave barbecue that is what anxiety and fear does right? Make me a delusional psycho who cannot get rid of the fear like it is the end of the world? I fear that what I do in the future may cause a seriously huge fucking mistake that I can never get out of it. I feel little as if my problem is nothing, even a problem that is caused by a tiny microscope virus is more important than what is going on through my fucking head, or whatever chemicals and neurotransmitters in my body are making me feel, think and act.\n\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nI am constantly feeling afraid. I am afraid of anything and everything at the same time\n\nI am afraid of what happened or what may happen.\n\nI am afraid the world, the earth, the skies, the stars, aliens, humans, animals, whatever fucking bullshit thought that had occurred in my head that makes my skin crawl.\n\nI am afraid of what I am or what I might become. I am afraid that I might go crazy or fight that I might become boring, or normal, or average, or weird, or some fucking hippie, or some fucking stupid hard-headed person. I am afraid that I might become too careless if I go to the \"yolo\" type of personality, or I become too much of a person who cares to much about anything. I am afraid that I don't know the balance that I need to find where I should not care too little but not care too much either. I am afraid that people see me or not see me. I am afraid of judgement of whatever action or move I make or even thought occurs in my head. I am afraid that my mind is going to make as crazy as those lunatics that you see on television or psychological thrillers. I am afraid of becoming boring and normal but at the same time, I am afraid that I will not be in contact of my own head. I am afraid that I will become some sort of stereotype where I will push people away and be known like some kind of psycho on the internet. I am afraid of the world and it's cruelty. I am afraid of what I am. \n\nI am afraid of fucking everything!\n________________________________________________\n\nI try to keep reading plenty of motivational quotes during the day just so that I can have some more strength during the day and for fuck's sake, it's like these motivational speakers cannot get their shit together.\n\n**\"Everything comes to you at the right time. Be patient and trust in the process\"** VS **\"If you keep waiting for the right time, it may never happen. Sometimes you have to make the most of the time you have.\u201d\n\n**\"Time heals all wounds\"** VS **\"The wounds remain. In time, the mind, protecting its sanity, covers them with scar tissue and the pain lessens. But it is never gone.\u201d**\n\n**\"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me\"** VS **\"Be careful with your words. Once they are said, they can be only forgiven, not forgotten\"**\n\nOh for God's sake ... Make up your fucking minds!!!\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nEveryday I compare myself to others, I always reading to endlessly look for whatever the achievement or advantage they have compared to me and everyday I feel little, either I feel as little as a bug compared to a giant Titan or feel as little as one human fighting against a bloody war of a million people, a war that most of the time, I feel like I will lose eventually. I feel like I am stuck in some sort of Hunger Games setting or a setting of a post-apocalyptic world or a war zone type setting where my every step, my every breathe feels like I am being watched and every step feels as fucking stressful because it may or may not lead to absolute failure.\n\nEveryday, I feel so close to accepting my fate, that I deserve living in this silent and quiet yet still empty and agonizing piece of shit hell.\n\nEveryday I feel empty. My mind, I cannot use it. I feel like I cannot process any data or information at all. I look at a book or a page or a letter and I feel like I am looking at a blank page or my mind is too stupid to even process whatever the hell I am trying to look or read. No wonder I get scolded for bad grades, called a lazy, worthless piece of fuck because I am too lazy or too stupid to care about exams and my future, but in reality, I deeply care too much as if I feel like the whole fucking world of 7 billion people, and millions or billions of other organisms are on my shoulders ... and all I can do is to shut down entirely. I shut down by brain, my thoughts, my emotions, everything because I cannot take all the anxiety. All the pressure. All the fear and terror.\n\nSometimes I feel as depressed as if I am a lonely guy in a post-apocalyptic setting where everyone is either dead or absent or gone. I walk and sit and breathe as I am the loneliest guy on the planet and at the same time, I feel as scared as well because of the post-apocalyptic setting ... not sure who is out there or what dangers out there may come out and get me. Sometimes instead of a post-apocalyptic setting, I feel like I am stuck in some sort of prison that I cannot get out where the whole country or even the whole fucking world is a global size prison system, like some sort of Orwellian 1984 setting. All because everywhere I go, whatever advert or newspaper or newscast, I hear these common words silently screaming at me as if the people on the other end of the newscast are saying **\"DOOM!! HORROR!! THE WORLD IS ENDING!! NOT REALLY BUT WE WANT TO MAKE YOU FEEL THAT WAY BECAUSE THAT IS HOW THE NEWS WORKS AND IT PROFITS FROM YOUR FEAR AND TERROR AND ALL OTHER DRAMA AND SHOCK AND CONSPIRACIES THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH BECAUSE OF OUR AGENDA OR CLEVER PSYCHOLOGICAL TRICKS THAT WE HAVE LEARNED BECAUSE IT IS FUN FOR OUR SELF-RIGHTEOUS JOURNALISTS AND WRITERS WHO THINK THEY CAN TWIST THE WORDS ON THOSE MAGAZINES AND NEWSPAPERS TO TURN YOU INTO OUR LITTLE PUPPETS/SLAVES!! HAVE A NICE DAY AND TOMORROW WE WILL DO THE SAME THING, ONLY IN A DIFFERENT WAY, SETTING, THEME, AND A NEW SCAPEGOAT TO PUT THE BLAME ON! SEE YA!\"**\n\nSometimes I go on Facebook or other social media and see on the smiles and joyful faces that people post ... showing how great their lives are and how happy they are, making me feel more miserable than I already am when I look at the news feed at night on my bed while everyone else is partying or having a good time\n\nBut eventually, every time, I notice that most of these are just fake smiles and fake social identities that we create for the public eye to see ... giving all those people around us that **THEY** want to see, show that we show all our xoxoxo and all the hashtags and the inspirational quotes that we can find so that we show how gorgeous and beautiful our lives are so that we get that slight dosage of dopamine or to be sedated so that we want to escape that hard impossible game with the hardest videogame boss ever called life, so that we make our lives less boring or less miserable.\n\nMakes me wonder on how far people go to show off how great their lives are but in reality, whatever goes behind that screen may not always be the truth, whether or not their lives that they are trying to hide really are less interesting or miserable.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nSometimes, I feel like my mind is screaming like it is a very vocal and toxic drill sergeant screaming on a fucking megaphone, sometimes it is a thousand voices whispering or screaming at once, sometimes it is all white noise, or sometimes it is not there - as if it just gave up and vanished and flew to the moon because it gave up trying to keep me alive and said \"fuck it, you are on your own\"\n\nEvery day, I feel like I want to hurt or kill myself.\n\nEvery day, I fantasize doing the most horrible thing to myself. Everyday when I look at the mirror, I feel like I want to break that ugly piece of shit face and smash it to the tiniest pieces until my own fists are full of blood and tiny pieces of glass.\n\nAnd even if I don't look myself in the mirror, even when I close my eyes, I picture myself as an ugly, unlikeable, horrible, piece of shit character that deserves whatever the fuck kind of shit is thrown at him.\n\nAnd I mean that on a literal sense - physically, emotionally, psychologically, financially, economically, culturally - whatever you fucking name it.\n\nI ask for professional help, and I will admit that I am thankful that I do. Maybe not all the professional help I was given was that helpful, probably because people have their own way of helping or maybe because we did not see eye to eye, but at least they tried but at least, I know what I am looking for in case I need some form of professional help. But I do only 1 hour in every 2 weeks.\n\nI have to talk about all that has happened between those two weeks in just one hour. After the session is over, I feel good for a while, but then ... the pain comes back\n\nThe silent whispering of an emotionally abusive devil talking to me. The silent sadness that you feel for no apparent reason yet somehow you feel too weak or too much of a pussy to do anything about it or even think that you deserve better because you feel like you deserve whatever painful feeling you are going through\n\nYou feel like you rather suffer a long and painful life rather than ending your life because you feel like you deserve whatever agony you are going through\n\nThe anxiety and panic attack come and go whenever they please.\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nSometimes it feels like you somehow been hit by an invisible truck and your body is as frozen as it somebody turned you into a popsicle and you have no other choice but shake from the inside.\n\nSometimes you feel like your whole body is about to shake and erupt like a volcano or an earthquake but you have to keep it in, like trying to keep the lid closed in a highly pressurized gas container that is about to explode because you don't want to make a scene, otherwise you are going to be ridiculed by your friends or your family because they look at you funny or say that you are crazy and deserve to be in a mental hospital.\n\nOr if this happens outside in a public area, you rather keep it all in and put on that happy smiley face like you always do so that nobody will look at you like you committed a crime or else people are going to tweet about this online and post photos and videos online and say \"what a weirdo\" or the media just loves to swim in the orgy of many they get for either making you look like that psycho guy/girl in the horror movies or like you use for their \"pity campaign\" making those with mental disorders appear less human need professional help as if they are people who are about to explode or they are people who have been supposed by the devil. And then you realize about the bunch of comments you get online.\n\nYou either find:\n\n- the trolls and sadistic psychopaths who like to LOL on your misery\n\n- the people who like to post \"OMG, so sad\" which basically does nothing else because apparently either they want to express their opinion about getting help but still wait for someone else to do it for them because they are either too lazy to do anything or don't want their perfect lives to be compromised for being in contact with a psycho or they want to do it because they want to look pretty and helpful in front of their friends on social media because they like that good public image and that dose of dopamine they get from all the likes they get\n\n- those who act like they got a master's degree in psychology, saying that we should do this or we should do that when in reality, they only watched a show on TLC *(which btw, I have told that no matter how real the characters are, they are mostly scripted and overly dramatized)* or watched just one documentary *(only one, if it was real and accurate, anyway)* and it is basically the most common and expected types of \"advice\" that we get like \"think of the positive\" or \"but you appear normal, I didn't know that you are mentally ill\" or \"you are ok, things will go better\" and giving you whatever type of cheesy motivational speech they can come up with *(though you do eventually get some comments that are more helpful like people advising you some helpful comments of sympathy and warmth, or advice you some particular meditation type or some good relaxing music or some green tea because at least, it looks like they know what they are doing or want to give you help without being your doctor or your psychologist)*\n\n\n- the kind of people who we are really looking for because they leave the most toxic comments ever. The people who just love to compare us to whatever type of fucking misery that exists in this god-forsaken, dirty, shitty, messy, fucked up world.*(in some cases, it is and it does look like it but it is not as fucked up as it was 10, 20 or even 50 years ago and thank God for it!)* **\"People have it worse than you\"** or **\"Look at those soldiers in the Middle East. That is real bravery and suffering because you are just a civilian\"** or how about **\"There are people who are suffering through the pain of cancer and you are suffering because you feel sad?\"** or I love this one **\"There are children out there who are dying of hunger. There are people out there who are living through war and tyranny and oppression. There are people out there who don't have a job. They have it worse than you!\"** Yeah, I am aware of that, asshole and I am sorry for those people too and I don't give a shit because they have their shit and I have mine and I am on the unlucky side because those people get some sort of sympathy and help (sometimes) and all I get is some \"get a grip\" quotes.\n\n- those people who are all \"tough love\" because life is not fair or we should get a grip and press on or that this is all imaginary and it is all in my head. Yeah, I know, dumbass. Life is the biggest bitch and bully out there and it never leaves you alone. Yeah, I know that life is not fair but I don't give a shit about how you managed to get a grip with your life. I appreciate your way of \"helping\" me but it doesn't help. Now fuck off and mind your own fucking business\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nAnd oh my god, my mind just fucking loves to humiliate me and torture me and make me like pussy ass bitch every single goddamn day because apparently I feel like I sold my soul to the devil at this point and I cannot do anything about it.\n\nSometimes, it is those days of depression with all the days of emptiness and sadness\n\nSometimes, it is those days of anxiety with all the panic attacks like it is the end of the world\n\nSometimes, it is those days of PTSD with all the fear and horror you get like you are somehow transported into some horror movie setting.\n\nSometimes, it comes in the form of suicidal tendency, like there is this invisible business man behind you, trying to sell you this  knife so that you can use it to stab it into your beating, soulless heart, or sometimes, it is just a barman with that wide selection of alcoholic beverages and whatever combination that us humans have managed to invent because fuck yeah, alcoholism makes all your problems go away and then it comes back again stronger and deeper than ever, with a bonus reward, a fucked up liver.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nI cannot sleep peacefully. \n\nI cannot spend my day without going through that piece of shit mind in an ongoing endless battle who is controlling who. \n\nSometimes I smile to fake and fill up that empty feeling of sadness and numbness but it never worked but I cannot help it because I am tired and exhausted and sick and fed up of that feeling of numbness.\n\nSometimes I smile to fake that feeling like the world is about to explode so that I don't look like an ass or a weirdo but I cannot help it because I do not wish to be treated as one as I was treated before.\n\nI cannot study because my mind is too busy in other bullshit stuff that I wished I had figured out much earlier but they keep coming back.\n\nI cannot eat without feeling with empty hole that needs to be filled yet it always ends up empty again. I cannot meet people or talk to people with having that smiley face again, sometimes I even over-emphasize my happiness by making jokes all the time and making an ass of myself. Sometimes I do as well to try to myself look funny so that I can get a date because I want to impress her as much as possible without showing her my real and genuine me because it might push her away on how I really feel inside\n\nI often say that it is too late to change or do anything about it so I rather just look at myself with contempt and disgust and see how much I fucked up *(and even then, I feel pity for feeling pity. I am angry for feeling angry not doing anything. And the cycle just seems to stay there and keeps going on and on and on and has been there probably for years at this point)*\n_______________________________________________\n\n_____________________________________________\nSo there, I am done with my rant.\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "mod_note": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "saved": false, "id": "5n56lm", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "no_follow": false, "author": "sammyjamez", "num_crossposts": 0, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "pinned": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.ptsd", "hidden": false, "num_comments": 15, "thumbnail": "", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "subreddit_subscribers": 13098, "secure_media_embed": {}, "media_embed": {}, "stickied": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "name": "t3_5n56lm", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/ptsd/comments/5n56lm/im_sorry_everyone_but_i_am_going_to_rant_here/", "subreddit_type": "public", "whitelist_status": null, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1484085747.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/5n56lm/im_sorry_everyone_but_i_am_going_to_rant_here/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "I'm sorry everyone but I am going to rant here because I cannot keep holding it in.

And so men stay stuck around anger, and we get told it&amp;#39;s our fault for not being able to change.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you&amp;#39;re able to find some support with the anger, which you rightfully deserve as long as it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt anyone else, or anything in your life you value.

But you have to let go of the anger. When you're angry and bitter your energy isn't going towards healing but towards feeding the fire. And it's draining. And it's so easy to fall into and I get that. When you can't even be in a room with the light on its hard to have a positive view of your capabilities. But what you have to learn to do is love yourself despite your flaws. That's it. The only way you're going to heal is to not work against your illness but work with it. And, dude, it's hard. And, you have to put what little energy you have into fostering the \"you\" outside of your illness. I love books. And it got to the point where I couldn't read because my brain was too fried and I was too fucking tired to ever even attempt pay attention to really anything. So every couple of days I would go to Barnes &amp; Noble. An hour or two before closing when there were only a few other people in the store. And I would just shop for books. Would I buy then? No, because I wasn't working and had no money. But it made me happy and it inspired me.

And happiness is contagious. Maybe the next time you're having a good day, you'll walk outside 7 minutes and maybe the next week 10. Or maybe next week you're having too bad of a week.

Maybe it's not the triathlons you were running before but it's still a person who wants to get out of the house. That's still your personality and you're not losing track of it. Therapy, medication, meditation, excercise, diet, that's all going to help anxiety. But for any of that to work you have to find the person you're trying to help amidst the chaos inside your mind. Whatever your passion is, feed it. Don't compare yourself to others. Don't tell yourself you're not good enough. Be you. And you is imperfect along with every single other person on this planet.
