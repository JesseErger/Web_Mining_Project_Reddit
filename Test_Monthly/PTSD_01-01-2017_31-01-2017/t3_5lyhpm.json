I'm severely agoraphobic, basically meaning my anxiety is so bad I struggle to leave my house. But I managed to make it out for Christmas Eve. We opened a few gifts. My dad bought a skillet for my brother in law. Later on in the night he lifted it up next to me and asked me how much it would hurt if somebody was hit over the head or something really fucked up like that.\n\nSo I have ptsd from being involuntarily sent to a psych ward because my parents talked to therapists and the only thing they could think to do to help my severe anxiety, autism and agoraphobia was to send me on a psych ward. I've been struggling with these issues my whole life and so much more I'm not telling you. This sent me into shock. I couldn't go home without reliving that night so I stayed in the hospital for a month. Someone tried to rape me there. The screaming and constant crying gave me sensory overloads because autism is hell and my ears are too sensitive. I wasn't actually getting therapy or any help. \n\nThen someone else suggested I live at a group home for autism, but it had very very very low functioning people including somekne with fetal alcohol syndrome who was violent. The worst things I can remember was him getting locked in solitary confinement which was not soundproof and punching the wall the entire night trying to get out and also pissing and shitting himself because here was no bathroom. He cut himself one day because he asked me for a knife to peel vegetables. Which fucked me up but not as bad as the next day when he poured katchup on his arms and triggered a post traumatic flashback. \n\nAnd most relevantly he beat the shit out of two women who worked there with a frying pan. He got sent jail and had to go to court but  nobody knew if he was coming back so that was the only reason they let me move out and I've been struggling living on my own ever since. He didn't get sent to jail but then he did for arson. I wasn't there for that though so oh my fucking god I can't even own a frying pan without getting fucked up over it. Or even katchup for fucks sakes. This was in 2009 to 2010 I think.\n\n\n\nAlso the ambulance workers came to my house while I was in the middle of jerking off before bed so I can't masturbate without crying. And someone tried to rape me in the group home and the  guy who birth the house said somebody was raping him.\n\nI\n\nSo all this came flooding back on New Year's Eve of 2012 when I was trying to actually be with my parents.\nExcept I thought my dad was going to beat me over th head wit a skillet. I can't stress the ract that m my anxiety already was at high levels. I don't really know why my dad said that but everyone except me was drinking a lot and I'm pretty sure my parents got traumatized from all of this too because they knew what was going on. ( I had to tell someone because my therapist told me I should t tell anyone else what happens outside of the house and it scared me that I might end up dead and nobody would know why. Also I just needed emotional support.) \n\n\nthe worst part is that I love Christmas but it just makes me cry out of complete and utter lonely was. I want a big family and friends not a bunch of stupid fucks who just traumatized me and remind me of two women being beaten by a frying. Pan weilding motherfucker.\n\nSo yeah Christmas is pretty much ruined for me. But it does get better over time maybe one day it will be ok. I have been going through a bit of a cancer scare though so I might be on borrowed time.
