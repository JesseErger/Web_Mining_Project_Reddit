I go to my therapist weekly for EMDR and talk therapy. And slowly but surely, I&amp;#39;m getting better. I&amp;#39;ve brought down all of my doses of meds, under medical supervision, and even been taken off of a few!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s scary. But giving that monster in your head a name is the first step to fighting it. It&amp;#39;s not you. It&amp;#39;s a separate entity that picks on you. Seeing doctors isn&amp;#39;t being weak- it&amp;#39;s building a team to help fight that monster. And medication and therapy are your weapons. This way of thinking has helped me so, so much. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You CAN do this. You CAN live with PTSD. If you need anything, even just someone to vent to, PM me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "ptsd", "name": "t1_dce25it", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ptsd/comments/5nowvs/living_with_ptsd/dce25it/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1484367436.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1484338636.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ptsd", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}]
