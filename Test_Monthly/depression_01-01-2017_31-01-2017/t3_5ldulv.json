This way our bond won&amp;#39;t be ruined when we inevitably couldn&amp;#39;t stand each other any more and have an ugly breakup. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, why am I not? I can shrug off most rejections with &amp;quot;she was too good for me, anyway&amp;quot;, leave it at that, and move on with my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why am I not feeling any better when I can come up with a million more reasons why it would never work out in a million years? I know it&amp;#39;s for the best. I&amp;#39;ve accepted it won&amp;#39;t change. But it doesn&amp;#39;t get better. It still hurts. And I never thought it would ever happen. My entire life I thought I was immune to this, because I never considered myself capable of falling in love in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, here I am. And I still don&amp;#39;t know how the fuck I ended up here. I still don&amp;#39;t know why what happened happened. All I know is that I regret it ever happened. I wish I could go back in time and restrain myself and remind myself of the life I wanted to have, and not get this close.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;#39;t listen to myself. I foolishly let it happen, thinking it was fine. Never imagining it could come back to bite me later. But it did. I got too close. It got too serious. And now there&amp;#39;s hell to pay. I have to carry this weight around for years. At the bare minimum. With therapy. And pills that don&amp;#39;t work for jack shit. I may be like this forever. Some say it never truly gets better. It may not hurt as bad. But it&amp;#39;s always going to hurt to some extent. And I don&amp;#39;t believe people who say it&amp;#39;ll pass. I think I&amp;#39;m damaged forever. And it&amp;#39;s all because I was too goddamn naive to consider what might happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this the real reason why major lifestyle differences are such an immediate turn off and cause to break contact for most? Once political views and beliefs and values stop being a barrier, EVERYTHING does. It gets to the point where you want to stand by someone no matter how rotten they become. What vile things they do. Because you&amp;#39;re used to doing it. Because you believe it&amp;#39;s the right thing to do. And you won&amp;#39;t listen if anyone tells you otherwise. It&amp;#39;s the cruelest joke in the world- because you find yourself so obsessed and committed, and willing to do anything at all for someone, you can&amp;#39;t stop loving them and move on, literally no matter WHAT happens. I could not have less in common with her if I tried. And yet, here I am. Hopelessly in love with someone who is never going to love me back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never want to get this close to someone. Ever again. I don&amp;#39;t want to feel pain and shock fresh ever again. I don&amp;#39;t want to carry any more burdens around. The fact of the matter is, there&amp;#39;s probably only one person in the world I was willing to consider breaking my dreams of living the free single life for. And she&amp;#39;s not interested. All that&amp;#39;s left for me is the idea and possibility of a life that I always wanted to live. And it doesn&amp;#39;t make me happy. I&amp;#39;d give it all up for her in a heartbeat if I could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily for me, I have surefire female repellent, as if my very existence in and of itself wasn&amp;#39;t enough of it. Apparently those of the female race think very lowly of men who pay for sex and want nothing to do with them, and certainly won&amp;#39;t date them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, screw &amp;#39;em. If they don&amp;#39;t want to give it to me, I am going to pay for it, in places where it&amp;#39;s legal to do so. And then it&amp;#39;ll be a damn sure thing I&amp;#39;ll never find someone who wants me. Because I am going to tell ANYBODY who gets too close to me what I did. And then they&amp;#39;ll make faces and run. I refuse to lie. How can you possibly love someone you&amp;#39;re lying to and keeping secrets from? The entire relationship has a rocky foundation waiting to crumble if word ever surfaces. That&amp;#39;s why I find it impossible to approach women. How am I supposed to say &amp;quot;Hello, I am interested in you purely for your body&amp;quot; and expect it to go over well? Because that&amp;#39;s all you know about a girl at first glance. It&amp;#39;s the only thing you COULD be interested in. But you can&amp;#39;t say that. But lying is bad. And thus... the eternal dilemma. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should be happy. I get to live the life I always wanted to have. Going off to have legal sex with prostitutes. Doing whatever I want without any extra baggage to worry about. Knowing it all ultimately doesn&amp;#39;t mean anything. It only does for a night. I should be overjoyed. My dreams will soon become a reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m not happy. Because it&amp;#39;s not what I truly want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t have what I want. It&amp;#39;s all merely settling for what I can have. Almost nobody gets to have what they truly want out of life. Even if what they want isn&amp;#39;t something atrocious. But maybe it was an atrocious idea all along. Unconditional love doesn&amp;#39;t truly exist, and I&amp;#39;m a warped human being who wants to believe it does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope they legalize prostitution in the rest of America, besides Vegas. Maybe this never would have happened if there was just a more accessible place you could go to turn in your virgin card once you hit 18. Maybe I&amp;#39;d have been satisfied with meaningless one night stands with women sooner. Maybe I would have been spared all of this heartbreak and pain, and maybe I never would have gotten as close as I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But maybe I was going to anyway. Maybe it was always going to happen, regardless of if I wanted it or not. Maybe it was fate. Maybe fate really exists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe none of this actually matters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First day of 2017 and I already hate my life and everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yay.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "She wants kids.
