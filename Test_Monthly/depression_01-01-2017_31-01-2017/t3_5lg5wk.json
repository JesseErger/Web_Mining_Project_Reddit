I came to these overwhelming realizations while I&amp;#39;ve been stoned, and by this virtue I don&amp;#39;t know if I can consider these realizations out right depressive symptoms or just moments of supposed clarity in the state of inebreation. All I know is that these moments stick with me through my daily life and have tangibly affected how I feel and act. Maybe I really have been depressed and these high realizations just provided rationalization for why I feel this way, or maybe this is caused directly by the weed. This makes it difficult to know if it is appropriate to make posts on here, as 2016 incidentally was also the year I began smoking pot habitually from the years onset, a habit that I had only picked up towards the end of the previous year and which also strangely correlated with the onset with this feeling of disgust. \nThe year 2016 has pushed me into an uncomfortably cushy state of apathy wherein all my ambitions, desires and pleasures have fizzled away. Out of the many undesired changes I&amp;#39;ve experienced over the year, my apathy has kept me from remembering every detail that I&amp;#39;ve conceived, but one that really stuck out to me happened last night during an attempt to reconnect with a friend who was visiting my city. He travelled there with his girlfriend with whom he was spending most of his time, and so I barely to catch up with him as a buddy. Whenever he made a comment towards me, I would bypass responding sincerely and just try to go for a smug witty response. This habit has gotten worse over the year, and they&amp;#39;re not even as impressive as they once were so it doesn&amp;#39;t make people laugh as much to distract them from my impersonability (one of the symptoms I forgot to mention). And since I was resorting to this everytime I was addressed my friend and anyone else I had met there started realizing and ended up talking to me less. I had realized that when doing this it was mostly unintentional and it impeded on my ability to actually connect with these people. It was another red pill realization that I&amp;#39;ve unintentionally been avoiding personal connection for the past year, and instead I&amp;#39;ve just been abusing my tendency to replace a two way conversation with a smart-ass remark. Whenever I didn&amp;#39;t poorly execute this i had absolutely nothing to say, and so I ended up staying to myself and observing everyone else have fun and enjoy each other&amp;#39;s company, while I observed as if through a TV. At some point I started to question whether I was on the autism spectrum, something I hadn&amp;#39;t considered before that. \nTo end this thought I just want to mention that I hope 2016 has been at worst an anomaly for what should otherwise be a good life for me, and what I mentioned here, though it may just be grazing on the surface of a myriad of issues I had, should be possible to backtrack from and return to my last point when I felt content. But this year I have repeated fond memories from earlier in my life and they felt bleaker and less visceral. I&amp;#39;m hoping that in 2017 I can gain my emotions, humor, joys, ambitions, and personality back because this apathy is torturous. \nI hope what I wrote here is coherent and fits well enough into this sub.
