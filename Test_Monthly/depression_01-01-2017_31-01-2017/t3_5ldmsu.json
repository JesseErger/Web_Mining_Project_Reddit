Both my brother and my sister are out at seperate parties, while im alone in my room. I have no connection to my parents, i feel so alone on new years eve when everyone else is having fun. All my friends left for college and havnt kept in touch, and my only online friends are all increasingly harder to reach. I feel like i only push those closest to me away when i try talking to them about how i feel. I never go out and do anything, im either at home or work, and even though me and my brother are &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; and his friends accept me when they come over, they never invite me anywhere, and i feel awkward asking if i can tag along. My mom rarely talks to me, my dad isnt good at being supportive (to say the least) my stepmom hates me one day and acts like were friends the next. When they try to encourage me to better myself its always in a degrading way, &amp;quot;youll be 300 pounds if you dont change the way you eat, look at yourself.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You need to eat less&amp;quot; &amp;quot;youre a terrible driver&amp;quot; things like that. Im not too fat imo but im not thin either, i have manboobs and i hate them, and i genuinely want to better myself, but its hard without support. For the past week or so ive just wanted to curl up in my bed and cry, and its only as im typing this post that im finally getting that release, i genuinely dont know where else to turn. I have an overwhelming fear of there being no afterlife and just nothingness after death that cripples me and keeps me awake at night which no one ive talked to yet acknowledges. I just feel like im in a shitshow and i have no one here to help me through it, and all i want is to be happy but it feels like that just isnt possible for me. Sometimes i think im happy for a bit, but i feel like ive just gotten so good at pretending that i even fool myself sometimes. All this is made worse by the fact that right before my friends left, for about 2 months i was genuinely happy, we all went out and did things and it was fun, but then they all left, and now i feel like that little taste of happiness only makes this pain worse because i know what true happiness feels like, and i feel like i can never achieve it again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Im 18, about to be 19 in a month (Feb.1) and a male, if that matters. \n\nAs im posting this its currently 11:50 PM right before the new year.
