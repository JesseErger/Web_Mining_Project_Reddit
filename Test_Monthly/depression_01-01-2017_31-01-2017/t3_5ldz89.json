This past year has been absolutely the hardest (outside of when I was hospitalized against my will about 15 years ago, which ended up doing zero good for me, surprise surprise.).

They say I don&amp;#39;t have cancer, which while horrible would have at least been an answer. It is entirely fucked up, I fully recognize that, but there are days that if a doctor told me I have only a month or so left to live, I&amp;#39;d cry in relief. I&amp;#39;ve seen specialists who treat me as just another number who got unlucky in life. Unlucky in life, boy, that sure does sum it up though. Abusive family, criminal father, automatic black sheep from birth, poor, redheaded, fat from young age, bullied, sick a LOT, etc etc. Blah fucking blah.

I do live at home, but at least that&amp;#39;s for a good reason I suppose. Those 2 hours I mentioned? That&amp;#39;s transporting my elderly grandfather back and forth from his day care program.

I could keel over any minute (hopefully) and then what? I guess he&amp;#39;d go to a nursing home. So I suppose I&amp;#39;m a better choice than those nightmarescapes of fucking places. I don&amp;#39;t know. I just want to fade away without harming anyone else, or myself for that matter. I don&amp;#39;t -want- to die, but I don&amp;#39;t see much of any other option.
