I&amp;#39;m sick of dealing with the weight gain, going to the gym 3-6 times a week has done nothing. 2. it seems to increase my anxiety at times. 3.Its expensive(even with a coupon code and insurance.)

I tried probably about 8 medications before I found this one- I really thought there was no hope beforehand.
