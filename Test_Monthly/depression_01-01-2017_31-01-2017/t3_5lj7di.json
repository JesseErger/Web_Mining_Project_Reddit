Over the past few years, my mother&amp;#39;s mental health has deteriorated drastically to the point of suicidal.  It is now at the lowest point and she has tried multiple times to commit suicide.  She had health insurance for when she had her double mastectomy early in 2016 but my father quit paying for it.  If she had health insurance, the doctor said she would have been put straight into inpatient care but instead she was urged to go to outpatient.  This is just not a possibility with her at this moment.  There is no way she is capable of going to get help herself and I do not know what else I can do.  I do not have much money as I am currently a college student.  I do not know exactly what are my options to try and get her some help and it has been difficult finding the right path to get her some help.  If anyone knows of a way to get some low cost options or even just a general direction for me to look, it would be much appreciated.
