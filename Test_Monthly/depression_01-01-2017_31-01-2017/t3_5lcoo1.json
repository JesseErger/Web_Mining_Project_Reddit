I am about to finish uni and I don&amp;#39;t know what I want with my life now that the plans I made with my ex have all fallen through.

It was so out of character and we had both agreed on numerous occasions that cheating was the most despicable thing you could do to a person. I want someone to fill the gap in my life which is loving someone and being loved but I have no idea if that will ever happen again which just adds to the feeling of hopelessness.
