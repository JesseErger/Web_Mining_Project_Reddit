I had to call her and tell her 1/2 of my medical situation; I don&amp;#39;t want to burden her with things that may make her life harder, and have become rather private about my life normally (I feel here I can just talk without being judged, so I am talking about it all now). It was productive and she is going to try to add me back on (we are still married), but I am in store for a fight with the insurance company so I can continue my treatments.
