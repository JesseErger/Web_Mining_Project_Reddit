I have a friend who lets just call Tyler. Its not his real name. A girlfriend called.... Maria? Sounds good. And a best friend lets call Shana. For the longest time I never had a depressed state, even when I was in high school. I always seemed to just be doing fine and that&amp;#39;s mostly because I was good at something. Video games have been my life, they used to become my cherished center where I could always go to escape life for a few good hours and come back refreshed. Where I had so much fun seeing developers make these stunning worlds and querky characters. It gave me the best years of my life, now its become a hellscape of depression and sorrow. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not all games, Undertale was a big helper in my dark times. Yet to this day most games give me this bitter feeling. So the reason why is im not good at anything, nothing at all. In real life I have no talent. In my job im seen as the weakest link (in all 7 which i got fired from my last recently) because I am physically weak. I have an issue where I am unable to remember simple things but can remember the most complex passwords. I can&amp;#39;t even remember my own name some days and I actually stand there thinking about it. I have no money and nor do I care but I was made fun of it alot. So video games was my big deal right? Unfortunately as of late my friends became so engrossingly good at it i can&amp;#39;t deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend can beat me at everything. Were having fun and I think its going to be a good time so we play Battleblock Theater for example. She always gets to the end on every single level, and gets most if not all the gems first. She uses these weird tricks and the thing is she has no previous experience before.....but she always wins. So much so she apologizes for it and rubs it in by saying shell let me go ahead..... like im a stupid child. Tyler on the other hand beats me at everything as well and makes it worse. Say a game like God Eater. I practice against a monster maybe 30 to 40 times. I even spent an entire day trying to master this fight against 1 creature. So game comes down and were playing with another friend but I die not once but 6 times. Hes laughing at me saying its easy and im a loser for dieing. He laughed even more pointing out he got an SSS rank (the highest) while i got a B..... cause i died entirely. I also play games like Overwatch and Killing Floor and even on those games he gets golds across the board and recently after losing on God Eater he flat out said &amp;quot;Why do we even have you here?&amp;quot; refering to our new friend getting the game, so he kicked me out and just now as I type they are all beating the final boss of the game with the new guy proving hes completely surpassed me....he uses my same weapon and all and called me &amp;quot;Useless&amp;quot; and saying &amp;quot;I should kill myself&amp;quot; .....i should, I truely believe failures like me should be euthanised. Make room for the great and the growing. If you have nothing at my age of 24 you should be removed from this earth and ground into fodder. im useless im garbage i hate myself i hate living and i hate freaking everything now, my life is just filled with failures and holding everyone back and im not good at a single thing no matter how hard i try or cry or sweat or work and nothing ever works out and even if i practice ghours after hours i alwys end up just being last dead last i want to win once i want someone to say i fucing matter at anything!
