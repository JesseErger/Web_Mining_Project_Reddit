Subsequently, as a result of my bad emotional state, I lost my job. I got kicked out of the house we were renting and later had to leave a flat I rented (neither was financial reasons) and had to move in temporarily with my parents and have slept on the couch in the living room for a few months now, not getting enough sleep and having no privacy, but I have no alternatives. I got depressed and I&amp;#39;m on antidepressants. I also got pretty sick, some significant limitations, surgery was on the table, still might be, but hopefully not. Also, I had the worst phases of tinnitus in my life recently and it drove me insane. I have 2 favorite hobbies that I need my right hand for, but I got a nasty inflammation in my right hand, so I can&amp;#39;t do my favorite hobbies. I lost a solid 35 pounds in 4 months because of depression. I felt better recently after being on antidepressants, found a girl that I like a lot and we had a trip planned, long distance relationship. I was looking forward to it for a long time, but I got sick again today and had to cancel and since this was the week when she had time off from work, God knows when there&amp;#39;ll be time again. I also worry that I will lose her for some reason now, being pathetic as I am atm. And I feel like that was the last drop. I sincerely don&amp;#39;t feel like going on after all of this, there is just no point in anything anymore. I&amp;#39;m so disappointed by getting sick again after struggling with health so much lately. Disappointed by not getting to spent intimate time with this girl again. I spent a month in bed just now and I&amp;#39;m already sick again. Wife started pushing hard for divorce on Christmas eve of all days (we were keeping this for when things calm down a bit, as it&amp;#39;s just a formality to us at this point). Today she visited my parents and went full passive-aggressive on me, brought back bad flashbacks. My mom, who&amp;#39;s my closest person in all of this... we have a slightly complicated relationship. She&amp;#39;s kind of a low key feminist and she has a tendency to take my ex&amp;#39;s side by default, identifying with her as she is also a divorced woman and she never entirely dealt with that. She was pretty cold today in communication with me after my ex&amp;#39;s visit today and it got to me. And I apparently can&amp;#39;t sleep, so I took sleeping pills and I&amp;#39;m starting to feel super sleepy as I&amp;#39;m typing this. Also, I noticed I suffer from forgetfulness and have trouble concentrating or falling asleep after starting to take antidepressants, which scares me. Overall, I&amp;#39;m just not sure anymore. The only positives in my life atm are my mom&amp;#39;s support and being able to look forward to spending time with this girl and both things just went out the window and I feel like... what&amp;#39;s the point in going on? IDK if there is any, IDK. I have to stop typing now as the sleeping pills are taking over, but just believe me when I say that this isn&amp;#39;t even close to everything that has brought me into depression, it was just an awful year for me in many ways. Even with antidepressants and therapy, it&amp;#39;s all too much now. Way too much. I find my self thinking over and over again that I don&amp;#39;t want to have to do this anymore, I just wanna die. I can&amp;#39;t get hospitalized or anything like that for this depression, as I need to financially support myself, my kid and my ex, since I&amp;#39;m the only one making money and I don&amp;#39;t have anybody in my environment who could support me in any way in this regard. I just don&amp;#39;t want to anymore. I wish I could get 3 or 4 good days, just a break and have things go well for a change.
