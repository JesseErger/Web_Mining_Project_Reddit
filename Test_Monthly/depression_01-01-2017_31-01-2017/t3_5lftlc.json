I&amp;#39;ve had depression since I was 8 years old. When I was a kid I was tortured by my entire school. I&amp;#39;ve been suicidal since I was 12, struggling with addiction since 14 and I am now 23. I&amp;#39;ve lived my life in a giving manner. Always making sacrifices to help others. I have been feeling lately that I have dug myself too deep to get out. Shit really started to go down hill when I was 17. I was in a happy loving relationship with a girl. It was fantastic we were best friends and shared everything. However she was 2 years younger than me and when I turned 18 her parents called the police. I did 180 days in jail I&amp;#39;m a registered sex offender until I&amp;#39;m 33 and on probation until next February. A little while after I turned 19 I feel in love again with a girl who I had a crush on since the ninth grade. We had a daughter I turned my life around I quit using and for a short period I didn&amp;#39;t hate myself anymore I didn&amp;#39;t even want to die. God I miss that. I worked nights slept a couple hours and watched my daughter all day while my fianc\u00e9 was at work while going to school online and managing all of our responsibilities. She left and took my daughter away just before thanksgiving just out of the blue. I tried to get her back. I fought I did everything in my power to get her back but she will not listen. I just want my family back but that will never happen. So tonight I will jump off a bridge into the Mississippi River. I&amp;#39;m done with all of this every time I try to dig myself out I dig the hole deeper. I just wanted to tell someone before I jump to get all of this off my chest and not feel so full of anxiety so I can live my last day with my daughter peacefully.
