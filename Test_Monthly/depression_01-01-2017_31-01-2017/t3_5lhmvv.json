I have been here for the past eight years and to say the least, the country I am from is very stereotyped... It is located in North Africa so I let you figure out the stigma that surrounds it. I feel alone here. I tried my hardest to make friends but none of them stuck around. I tried to befriend people from different cultures and not just stick with my own (a thing a lot of immigrants do when they move abroad) but I feel like that backfired at me... I am not religious, so my own people do not like me and I am now seen as &amp;quot;the wannabe white guy&amp;quot;. Other people (mainly natives) get to know me but they never want to do anything with me. Truth be told, I arrived here at 16 so all the groups were formed and all the friends were &amp;quot;taken&amp;quot;. I try to be nice to people. I try to show them the good side of my culture by inviting them to do stuff and actually paying for them (don&amp;#39;t think I am desperate, I do this occasionally when I get a good vibe from the person) but it never works. I do very well at school and according to my brother, people do not like me because they are jealous... I am not sure what to think of that.\nI used to have interests but all those disillusions faded them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EMOTIONALLY:\nI have a rather strong personality but no persona. I am the same with everyone regardless of who they are (except my family of course, who I draw limits with). People think I am too straightforward and too blunt. I just do not like to do things that I do not enjoy doing and my &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; get frustrated and mad at me because I do not follow the rest of the people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MOTIVATION:\nI do well at school as I said previously, but my motivation dropped drastically lately. I do the bare minimum. Thank god (or the force) I was gifted with good brains that save my lazy piece of shit ass when needed. I feel like I could do a lot more, but my depression hinders every step that I try to take.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RELATIONSHIPS:\nMy ex-girlfriend cheated on me, yet I got back with her. She cheated on me with my so-called &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot;. I got back with her because, on the spot, she apologized and I felt sorry for her because she, herself, underwent severe depression before I came along and saved her. I recently broke up with her because she did not keep any of her promises and also, she is constantly on the move and never really regained my trust ever since I found out she was playing me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like I hit rock-bottom. I am deeply, deeply, deeply sad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR&lt;/strong&gt;; I feel like no one accepts me for who I am.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am really down but I would really appreciate any constructive comments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello everyone,\nI am sorry in advance if there is any rule that I should follow when posting this.\nWhere do I start?\n\nCULTURALLY:\nI currently live in Canada but I was born abroad.
