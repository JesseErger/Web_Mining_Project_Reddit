After High School I gradually became less bitter, made jokes about how great I was... then the jokes gradually stopped being jokes. It seems for most people it gets better with age. It doesn't for everyone, but there's always hope there.\n\n\n\nI can't tell you how to deal with loneliness or depression. I can explain loneliness as I understand it and hope that helps. I can recommend therapy to deal with depression. Otherwise, again, those both often get better after High School. High School is a messy place full of teenagers with messy hormones. It can be hard.\n\n\n\nI can't tell you how to keep your friends either. But I can suggest you look up things like the book \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\", or the youtube channel \"Charisma on Command\" and think about how you come across to others. The way we act, even subtly can affect how people perceive us, being aware of that and changing even minor things (Like saying 'I don't mind', instead of 'I don't care') can make drastic improvements on how you come across.\n\n\n\nOne more thing, I started to feel much better when I stopped caring about being more invested in the friendship, relationship, whatevership. Oddly it made me both more and less invested. I invite people to do things, or start up conversations with people just because I want to. If they don't want to, I don't mind. I give friendship out as I want like a gift, not expecting anything in return. I think people often WANT to be a better friend, they WANT to be there for you, but they don't know how. \n\n\n\nYou say you're fat too, I'd suggest you change that. Not even to stop people teasing you or anything. Fuck 'em. Plenty of fat people are incredibly popular. But you've stated that you hate yourself and have low self esteem. I believe losing weight will be a step in the right direction in that regard. Keep it simple, just replace soft drink with water. Or, if replacing it altogether is too much, just drink a glass of water before you have any soft drink and you'll drink much less. Gradually replace your bad dietary habits with good ones. By 2018 you won't even recognise yourself.\n\n\n\nYou're young and you want to improve, you're gonna do fine.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote a comment explaining my understanding of loneliness that I think might help you if you&amp;#39;re interested in giving it a read &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5lb631/id_rather_be_all_alone_than_feel_alone_in_crowd/dbv5l4h/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t tell you how to stop hating yourself, but I can tell you that I used to hate myself and was in a bad place in High School as well. After High School I gradually became less bitter, made jokes about how great I was... then the jokes gradually stopped being jokes. It seems for most people it gets better with age. It doesn&amp;#39;t for everyone, but there&amp;#39;s always hope there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t tell you how to deal with loneliness or depression. I can explain loneliness as I understand it and hope that helps. I can recommend therapy to deal with depression. Otherwise, again, those both often get better after High School.
