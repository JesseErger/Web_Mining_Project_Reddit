I cried myself to sleep because I couldn&amp;#39;t understand the world, nothing made sense to me, just so confused at how anything worked, one day I&amp;#39;m just not going to exist and I don&amp;#39;t think I could imagine living forever so what did I want?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made friends with girls, losing my best (m) friend to football. I became very alone in primary school. I would walk around with only myself to keep me company. \nThere was a &amp;#39;lunchtime supervisor&amp;#39; I guess you&amp;#39;d call her who noticed I was always alone, I&amp;#39;d wait by this fence for her to come up to me, she always had sweets hahah. We used to walk around together and talk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She left and I guess I just always was with girls. People played me, even at that age but it was okay, it wasn&amp;#39;t that bad. You know, popularity was a thing even at that age. I had a bestfriend at some point (f) but she was popular and I was wierd. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Highschool came, I choose to be in her form and another girl&amp;#39;s, she kind of hated me at that point but we got closer again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By yr 9, I made friends with this &amp;#39;alt girl&amp;#39;, Idk what you&amp;#39;d call her, she wash speaking to her older boyfriend, always had arguments with him. We quickly became bestfriends and even though I was depressed it was easily the happiest I&amp;#39;d ever been. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started smoking because drugs always fascinated me and it was the closest I could get. We were both pretty popular, I a friend (m) who was popular that I&amp;#39;d play games with over Skype.  Good times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yr 10 came and my best friend left me for a girl. It crushed me and I began finding ways to drink, not that it was easy, just a few beers from my mum etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quickly got extremely depressed, I became an easy target now that she was gone and I was confused, I guess I sortof &amp;#39;followed&amp;#39; them round for a bit which must have made me an easier target.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People would make fun of me, call me gay and stuff because of my young shitty appearance I guess. I did try. I think I still played games over Skype with the guy at this point, which was nice, he was nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I switched to vaping to cut costs and for health reasons plus I could simply order stuff online. I vaped heavily as it was my coping mechanism along with self harm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember turning into an empty zombie which was good because it let me cope.  I took caffeine pills everyday to keep me awake which actually improved my grades greatly because I&amp;#39;ve always been so tired.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By yr 11 things were approaching a sort of neutral line. I hung round with a group that I knew didn&amp;#39;t like me but I had always kept a little influence over people.

(I had quit vaping for exams in yr 11). I finally (though it took all of last year) got meds for depression (fluxetine) I&amp;#39;m on my second week of taking it but I starting to realise that a simple pill isn&amp;#39;t ever going to help me. I have gender dysphoria, I hate how I look, I can&amp;#39;t stand my past and I&amp;#39;m so alone. I have my new bestfriend, let&amp;#39;s call her lucy, we became friends walking home together and when thus other group went to town in yr 11. She has helped me so much and she is the only person that I&amp;#39;ve told about my depression, I&amp;#39;ve also told her about my gender dysphoria to an extent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so alone rn and I realise that this isn&amp;#39;t ever going to get better.
