Seeing one doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily lead to anti-depressants or other drugs, so you&amp;#39;ll at least have the chance to say that your depression isn&amp;#39;t as bad as some other people&amp;#39;s. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "depression", "name": "t1_dbvejjx", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/5lfo84/i_feel_like_im_not_even_entitled_to_call_myself/dbvejjx/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483322714.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483293914.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 7, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lfo84", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbw3oyc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CitizenSerf", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5lfo84", "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "When someone tells you to knock off the pity party, I want you to smash that person in the face as hard as you can.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone tells you to knock off the pity party, I want you to smash that person in the face as hard as you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "depression", "name": "t1_dbw3oyc", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/5lfo84/i_feel_like_im_not_even_entitled_to_call_myself/dbw3oyc/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483357787.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483328987.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 7, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lfo84", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbvbp9o", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Rjected", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5lfo84", "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I've noticed that I've been \"looking\" for depression in other people.
