After my primary talked about starting me on this new Med I got concerned and turned to the community for testimonies and different peoples experiences. After cycling off Cymbalta which was hell by the way I&amp;#39;ve been on trintellix 5mg for 3 days now the side effects are unreal. Nauseous 5 minutes after taking medication until I go to bed 14 hours later mood swings are off the charts I&amp;#39;ve been more depressed than I have been in the past 6 months and to add to it I am now light-headed and dizzy constantly. And don&amp;#39;t get me wrong I understand when starting a new Med I am prone to nausea and mood swings and instability or whatever else you want to call it but I have never been nauseous for 2 days as a side effect and I&amp;#39;ve never had mood swings comparable to this. My head is always killing me which again common side effect of antidepressants ssris you name it but this is weird. It seems like a disconnect between my brain my head and my body.. I don&amp;#39;t know how to explain it other than foggy Maybe.. I&amp;#39;ve also noticed when I get a spike in Adrenaline,  and then settle back down it seems to hit me all at once.  and coming down from adrenaline on this is not a gentle slope into calmville, its an abrupt atom bomb of whatever chemical it may be and it bottoms me out so far that I&amp;#39;ve nearly collapsed while working twice. I mostly just wondering if this is a potential side-effect that may go away after chemical levels balanced out or build up, but this is unnatural and I&amp;#39;m not going to be able to stay on this medication any longer if this continues. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar. who knows maybe I&amp;#39;m just all sorts of fucked up and need something closer to a lobotomy.
