Sorry this is a bit long. I&amp;#39;m looking for some advice or words of wisdom on how to cope with a severely depressed and suicidal best friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been best friends since high school. We went to different colleges, but she ended up transferring to my school (huge state school) this year. It&amp;#39;s been hard on her -- she hasn&amp;#39;t made many friends. I hung out with her often and always invited her out with my friends, but I think she feels uncomfortable joining and my friends find her to be annoying. She&amp;#39;s been struggling with depression and anxiety for as long as I&amp;#39;ve known her and has been consistently in therapy. She thought she was bipolar, but recently found out that she actually has borderline personality disorder and her parents/doctors have known for years. I think this makes her even more depressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This year she got really into xanax and was constantly barred out. I don&amp;#39;t fuck with drugs for a lot of reasons and she is always pressuring me to try them, so I feel very uncomfortable around her when she&amp;#39;s super messed up. One night she showed up at my dorm at 3am and passed out in the hallway after taking 7 bars and mixing it with alcohol. I took her to the emergency room and she stayed at the hospital for several days in the psychiatric ward. She doesn&amp;#39;t get along with her family and refused to let her parents visit her or make any medical decisions. During this time, I was the only person she would contact so I brought her everything she needed, visited multiple times daily, helped her get excuses for all her classes, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After this incident she promised she was done with xanax. I know now that she continued to abuse it almost daily, but was more secretive about it. She went out and partied every weekend, acting like everything was fine. She got fired from her job (we work together) and failed all her exams. She found out that she&amp;#39;s pregnant and doesn&amp;#39;t know who the father is, and asked me to come with her to get an abortion. She told me she was going to take the next semester off and try to figure things out. She blamed me for encouraging her to transfer and not being there for her. In hindsight, I know I could have done more to help her adjust to the new school, but she repeatedly told me she didn&amp;#39;t like my friends and wanted to make her own. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She hooked up with my ex boyfriend when she was blacked out. I forgave her because I know she doesn&amp;#39;t remember it and wouldn&amp;#39;t have done it sober, but it still upsets me when I think about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two days ago she tried to kill herself. She drank half a bottle of vodka and took 20+ different types of pills. She sent me a suicide note via text in which  she wanted me to send paragraphs she&amp;#39;d written to multiple different people. There was a note for me at the end-- she said that I &amp;quot;was never there for her&amp;quot; and that she feels sorry for me because I&amp;#39;m more &amp;quot;fucked up&amp;quot; than she is and I don&amp;#39;t even realize it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I called her immediately, got her to send me her location, and then called 9-1-1 and her parents. When the ambulance got there, she was foaming at the mouth and they said she would have died within 20-30 minutes. Her mom has been keeping me updated the past two days. She woke up today and luckily doesn&amp;#39;t have any brain damage. She&amp;#39;s been asking to talk to me but doesn&amp;#39;t have access to her phone and doctors won&amp;#39;t let her speak or visit with any non-family members.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know what to do. The past six months have been hell for her, but also for me. She hasn&amp;#39;t been there as a friend at all, which is completely understandable given the situation, but I&amp;#39;ve found myself becoming more distant from her. She tells me that I&amp;#39;m the best friend she&amp;#39;s ever had, and then the next day says everyone else is telling her to not be my friend because I&amp;#39;m such a shitty person? I feel like I&amp;#39;m becoming depressed myself now. My therapist told me that the friendship is toxic. Everyone thinks I&amp;#39;m crazy for sticking by her. But all  her other friends have abandoned her. I see how much pain she&amp;#39;s in, and I know she would do the same for me. At the same time I don&amp;#39;t think I can keep this up much longer. I&amp;#39;m still her best friend, but she&amp;#39;s no longer mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It makes me so sad to think about all of the good memories we have together. Would a true friend stand by her through this, even though she doesn&amp;#39;t seem to want me to? I don&amp;#39;t ever want to be in this situation again where her life is in my hands. Any advice/input would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi there. Sorry this is a bit long.
