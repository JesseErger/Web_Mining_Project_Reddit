I have it well. Life is good to me. \nI get good grades at school (B/A), I have (some) friends, I have a nice family (my parents got divorced ~3 years ago, but that&amp;#39;s fine).\nEverything is just fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But somehow I feel like my whole life is &amp;quot;meh&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t see any point in doing anything. \nI have hobbies; I like video games, I play the piano, I make videos, I do some photography. I have interest in politics. \nI go to a school where I do things I like; photography, video game design (yes, Norway is weird and privileged), video editing etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just lose motivation so quickly. &amp;quot;Oh, I&amp;#39;ll play this game.&amp;quot; Ten minutes go by. &amp;quot;Uh, this is boring/unrewarding/I could be doing something better/etc.&amp;quot; \nOr; &amp;quot;Oooh, I&amp;#39;ll make this video game.&amp;quot; I work on it for 2 days. &amp;quot;I could just go back to not doing anything, and not have to do this.&amp;quot;\nI&amp;#39;ve been trying different things.
