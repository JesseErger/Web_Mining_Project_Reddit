One stole a pretty substantial amount of money from me, another was that ones twin, another ridiculed and belittled me behind my back to try to get into bed with an ex of mine, etc. Although, a woe from the year before, I am also dealing with my best friend marring and moving across the country. Any thing even remotely romance related is a self destructive mess. I was introduced to a young women and her young son back in July. We talked for a while and I was instantly head over heels for this girl. The first person I had really been interested in after calling off an engagement in early 2015. I proceed to spend the next six months busting my ass for someone that only sees me when it is convenient to her, under the self illusion that she had just been burnt to many time and had suffered a rough enough home life that she would just take time to warm her up to the idea of something steady. She has done me wrong some many times in that time that I&amp;#39;ve lost count. Last week she calls me wanting help because they have no where to go. What can i do, put a two year old on the street? The entire time up until last night has been decent, then she drops on me that some guy is blowing her up because they went on one date and she won&amp;#39;t go on another. Mind you, in the time I&amp;#39;ve know her, she&amp;#39;s bailed on every single date we have had planned that involved anything more than hanging out at my place. We had plans for me to take them out to dinner tonight. Where am I? At home, with a bourbon on the rocks, being a burden on the rest of the Reddit society on New Years. Mean while, she is out with her &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; and wont respond to anything. So, cheers to 2017. I hope for a fantastic year to anyone who has sat through my tears and maybe one not so destructive for myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "In twenty-five years of existence, 2016 has had to have been the worst year of my life.
