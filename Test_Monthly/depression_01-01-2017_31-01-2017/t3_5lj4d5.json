I look in the mirror and feel absolutely disgusted with what I see. I dread waking up in the mornings as I can feel a new pimple or bump on my face that wasn\u2019t there when I went to sleep. I have lost myself to acne completely, and it\u2019s ruining my life. I take a shower, and don\u2019t want the mirror to show how inflamed and disgusting my face is. I just want a normal face color. I\u2019m tired of browsing routines, regimes, diets, medications, products, birth controls because it all feels helpless. I just feel as though I am a lost cause. Acne isn\u2019t the problem making me depressed, it\u2019s my reaction to it. I can hardly remember a time when I felt confident without a full face of foundation. I feel as though I\u2019m fighting a losing battle everyday as I will take it and tell myself it doesn\u2019t matter, but the majority of the day it\u2019s all I think about. I\u2019ve become obsessed with it, because I want it to be gone. It makes me feel \u201cunhealthy\u201d and unattractive. I think when people see it, they think there is something wrong \u2013 making me ugly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As much as I love my boyfriend, and I know how much he loves me, I can\u2019t help but letting this skin disease and my mind tell me I\u2019m not worthy of him because of it. He should be with a girl who has a flawless face, who doesn\u2019t go to sleep with spot treatments on her face, and wakes up crying about a new cyst that formed overnight. He deserves to wake up to someone who can roll over and smile confidently at him knowing that she isn\u2019t covered in disgusting cysts and pimples. He should have a girlfriend that doesn\u2019t have breakdowns about how I feel, and how disgusting I look; essentially having to talk me down all the time. It\u2019s a burden and it\u2019s annoying, he should not have to deal with it. I don&amp;#39;t want to tell him or anyone how I feel, because no one should have to deal with a depressed person; he should have a fun, outgoing person. (The person I was before acne took over my life) It makes me feel unworthy of having children, They would deserve a mother who doesn\u2019t hate the way she looks and feels depressed because of it. How could I possibly have children when I feel and look like this? I feel like my nephew deserves an aunt who doesn\u2019t let these things affect her, a better aunt than I am. I even feel as though I don\u2019t deserve my dog, she is so good and pure and I\u2019m so depressed and self-hating. My dog makes me so happy, but I even feel unworthy of her love.  I am starting to hate myself, which I really had never done before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know people say it doesn\u2019t define you, but I\u2019m letting it define me. I know people they don\u2019t care about it, but they have to. It\u2019s become severe, and I can\u2019t do anything currently to stop it. I\u2019ve sunken into a deeper depression every day, I\u2019m having a hard time enjoying myself with anything anymore because of how profoundly unhappy this makes me. I know it\u2019s something internal, but what more could I do. I feel as though I\u2019ve tried everything except Accutane, which is going to happen at the end of this month due to the waiting period. I was told all hormonal birth control essentially balances your hormones, so I don\u2019t know if the birth control I\u2019ve been on for 5 years is hurting or helping; but I\u2019ve had acne before starting it. I tried Spiro, which caused more and more breakouts for 8 weeks.. I\u2019ve been on antibiotics for 6 years or so, and they have finally stopped working. I\u2019m happy to start Accutane, maybe it will give me a new lease on life. Or maybe I will be back where I started. I can\u2019t take this anymore, every day I feel closer and closer to the ledge.. I know this sounds dramatic, but I cry about this all day and night and think about it 24/7. It\u2019s driving me insane. I\u2019ve tried to distract myself, but I\u2019ve had a hard time doing that lately. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t sure what sub to post this on.
