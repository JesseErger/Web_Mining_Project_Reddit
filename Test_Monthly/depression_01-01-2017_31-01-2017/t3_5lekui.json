Anyways, me and my husband join my friend (who happens to be pregnant) and her boyfriend (who is a recovering alcoholic) for dinner earlier tonight after they leave an AA meeting. All&amp;#39;s well and we depart from them around 11 hoping to find something to do as a couple. We end up coming to the conclusion that we have nowhere to be and go home to do what we always do. My husband plays on his xbox and I watch youtube videos. Literally. I&amp;#39;ve been depressed for years but its little situations like this that get to me. How did I let myself get to this point? I used to have so many friends and so many things to do. But I always just push everyone away and I don&amp;#39;t realize it until its too late and too far gone for an apology. I did however start a new job today after not working for the past year and a half after giving birth to my son and staying home to take care of him. I&amp;#39;m hoping things will change. New job, new semester. I just can&amp;#39;t help but to cry though. My husband gave me a peck at midnight and he continued on and so did I. He fell asleep around 2am and I ended up leaving and just getting back home 2 hours later. I went for a drive and walked around Wal-Mart. Yeah. Its not our relationship that saddens me or anything about my home life or anything in particular. I feel like everyday gets slightly worse. I want so badly to be a happy person for my husband and my son. I see my husband mirroring my actions and my attitude of disgust toward life and I hate it. I want to get better so badly for my family. I have an appt this month and I hope to go regularly if I can afford the copay and a sitter- which is why I got a job. I want to stop feeling useless and hated by my peers.
