I was just an adoloscent who got through 6 months of not enjoying anything really, ignoring it, getting into a short maniac phase and slowly having it ending. Oh, and I watched the Rebuild of Evangelion movies, they were pretty awesome. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In February however, I really lost it and fell into a deep, deep hole. I had in the first week of it vacation and for the first time in my life, I felt lonely. Normally, I only felt bored when I was alone. But this time, I really, really wanted to have people around me. And not just friends, I also started from this point on to get interested in girls and scince then, I, uhm, &amp;quot;search&amp;quot; (that sounds wrong...) for a girlfriend. This was suprising. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was never interested before in romantic relationships. I had only 2 crushes before and with neither did I want to engage in anything, so I never hit a girl. And it&amp;#39;s very awkward to get into this when you&amp;#39;re around 16, it&amp;#39;s interesting, honestly. So much changed inside of me. I didn&amp;#39;t feel weird when I got euphoric about the thought of, uhm, cuddling. Also, I learnt that I have no type. Like, if the girl&amp;#39;s skin is clean and she&amp;#39;s neither super over/underweight, she&amp;#39;s fine in my eyes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This lead me to get into a girl I already knew since a few months. I already feared that we maybe won&amp;#39;t get this along as a relationship. I thought our personalities wouldn&amp;#39;t fit very well. However, this changed quickly as I talked with her about politics and she said that &amp;quot;those filthy niggers and muslims need all to die&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This showed me that a personality problem might not be the thing that breaks the camel&amp;#39;s back. I mean, I really doubt that a relationship with a racist could work, mostly because many people I get along with are muslims, and a few family members are, and I really am not a big fan of racism, mostly because I am very mixed and brown. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It really took away my believe in humanity. And I don&amp;#39;t mean the one kind people are joking about. I really believed that the world is at doom because of the ignorance and hate of many, many people out there. I didn&amp;#39;t give myself and the rest of the world any future. Everything remembered me on the failure that we are. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then... I think it was on the second or third of March, I got ill. My blood pressure is normally a bit lower than usual, but around that time, it was so damn low I couldn&amp;#39;t stand sometimes. It made me weak and fatigued, unconcentrated and dizzy all the time. I got panic attacks, about once a week. Atleast. And mostly: it gave me the feeling of never, ever, just feeling a tiny bit... like, home. It felt like floating in a weird, alien, dark and cold environment, as far away from everything you feel comfortable with as possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It improved when spring started. I still remember thinking &amp;quot;I am at constant pain, have no future and basically feel as bad as I could, but the sun is shining atleast.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, and that was the big turning point of 2016, I got medication against my low blood pressure. Basically some drops that tasted like rotten tangerines (aka it tasted real bad). They worked after a week or so. I was hitting the gym more often to improve my body situation. It was very effective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, to explain how I felt after this, was kinda like a normal situation with my thoughts being as fast as in a maniac phase. It was damn awesome. I was finally again able to do conservation, I knew what to talk about, how to talk and how to be someone people want to talk with. I was a freaking social butterfly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t give a shit about what people thought about me, I&amp;#39;ve seen the worst and I knew that some bad thinking and mean looks about and at me aren&amp;#39;t as bad as I always assumed they are. I enjoyed my life. I even got out! I played soccer and was at parties and I was shopping with others... I was never really bored the whole spring over. I mean, I still wanted a girl, but I had friends. And I got close to my coworkers, I think I was one of the more popular guys at my workplace. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this is shocking. I also visited in this time my old school and noticed that I really never met many people there and was not popular at all. Back then, I didn&amp;#39;t care, but now I felt like I missed some things out when I was just surrounding myself with the people I already know. But now, I knew lots of people and made many laugh. I even got recommended to start stand up comedy once. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But... It ended way too quick. My mom got between me and my friends. She didn&amp;#39;t allow me to see anyone besides people she knew and she didn&amp;#39;t wanna know my friends because she was convinced that they were garabage. I mean, she was right, but I am still extremly angry at her for her decision. She killed my social life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she doesn&amp;#39;t accept that she did this. She always says now &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t forbid anything&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t make others responsible for your problems&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;You can still see people we know&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Just search for new friends on Facebook&amp;quot;. Worst part is that my dad who actually would&amp;#39;ve allowed me this didn&amp;#39;t step into this. Like, not at all. And my sister is now always calling me a friendless loser...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this made clear that I don&amp;#39;t want to live with those people for a long time. I think once I find a flat and have enough money, I will instantly move out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, that was not the turning point to my worse. The big turning point was this one: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/5fyp8r/what_was_the_biggest_disappointment_of_your_life/dao3vvs/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/5fyp8r/what_was_the_biggest_disappointment_of_your_life/dao3vvs/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Friday was btw a birthday at work. The coworkers I invited stayed longer than they should just for the party and they were giving me a ton of alcohol, a few bodybuilding/porn magazines and a book with bad jokes. It was awesome. I really felt like an equal to people who were all far older than me. It was really awesome and if it wasn&amp;#39;t for this, I don&amp;#39;t think I could&amp;#39;ve stayed through the weekend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think about maybe doing something with them, even though they are all far older than me, I think I will feel comfortable with this. Too bad that some of them are women and once my parents met them they will talk with me about how I should start a relationship with and marry once I am 18... Man, I mean, I never got hit by my parents. I always got something to eat, drink and to entertain myself, but they are just fucking me up emtionally and I can&amp;#39;t even talk with them about this because they will never change. Only scream, play the victim and insult me. There is sure some bias in here, I am in the end not exactly normal with my will for independence and freedom. It&amp;#39;s just far bigger than in most others and I feel oppressed really quick, but I really don&amp;#39;t feel like it&amp;#39;s normal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never seen other children being treated this way and whenever I talk with others about this, they insist that this is defiently not okay what they are doing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But back to topic, not all turned immediatly left. I still felt good mostly, made connections to people and was still deemed as funny and entertaining. Mostly because I am a weird guy and have a weird history with many weird things and people in it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It did turn kinda left tho over time. As above said, I had a lot of stress in the family. And I had no friends. And I got slower. By autumn, I was depressed again. However, not nearly as bad as ever before, really. I was and am kinda normal with a lean to a depressive episode, but I learnt how to express my problems to others (even though I never told anyone by now about my mental problems) and how to be still productive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And whilst it all got downhill, I am still rather high. I brought just some time ago two people in the same week to cry out of laughter. Or wait, actually, I think it were even 3. I am scared tho of this year. I am scared of going through everything again. And scared of maybe going backwards. But I hope that this year will be more good than bad. Last year was on the other side both the best and the worst year of my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh and: I hope the year will be good for you too. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I mean, it was both awful and great\n\nJanuary was the last month where I still had my old values and personality, the same goals and the same outlook.
