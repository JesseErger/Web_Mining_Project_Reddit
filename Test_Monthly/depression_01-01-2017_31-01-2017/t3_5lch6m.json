First you need to understand what makes you unhappy and generally, unhappiness comes from three sources.\n\n\nThe first way is that your brain just isn't producing or maintaining enough of the chemicals that make you happy. This is persistent unhappiness and is due to a systematic problem that needs to be fixed. We usually just label it depression, but there are a myriad of things that can cause this. Drug and alcohol abuse are common ways to screw up your brain. When you exercise or have sex, your body endogenously produces some feel good chemicals. The system that regulates this has evolved for thousands and thousands of years and will not overdose your brain on these feel good chemicals. When you're pouring in chemicals from an external source, there is basically no way to regulate the dosage so it is very easy to go above whatever limit would be considered safe. Having persistent sleep issues that have no apparent source or feeling anxious or sad ALL the time, then you should visit a doctor as that may be the only way to fix this type of problem.\n\n\nThe second source of unhappiness can be equally persistent but is due to a problem with perception. A common example is being unhappy with your appearance. To be unhappy about how you look, you have to first put a high value on physical appearance, have some pre-existing ideal of beauty and be rating yourself as uglier than your ideal. It is a good thing to care about how we look since we use looks to quickly judge people we don't know. But how much do YOU actually value looks when it comes to the people you spend your time with and care about? It is probably not at the top of your list. There is no reason to think it would be at the top of everyone else's, so perhaps you are overvaluing the importance of how you look. Additionally, your ideal version of beauty is completely subjective. You may look fine to others and this is the goal of putting time in to your appearance, so there is no problem here.\n\nThe last thing that can lead to unhappiness is inaction. If you're in a bad relationship and it is causing you misery, the problem isn't going to fix itself. You gotta get out of there. Similarly, if you're single and in a rut, sittting around at home isn't going to fix your problem. Go out and meet some people. If you're upset with yourself for not eating healthy, change up your habits.\n\n\nIn general when trying to diagnose some source of unhappiness, always analyze your situation objectively and ask yourself why you feel a certain way. Don't stop at \"I feel ugly\" or \"I feel lonely\". Ask yourself why you feel ugly or lonely and keep going until you have a plan in place to fix your problems. If there is nothing you can do, you need to adjust your expectations to meet reality (this usually happens naturally over time, but actively accepting your situation can help speed up the process). Therapy helps here. If there is something you can do, make a plan and do it.
