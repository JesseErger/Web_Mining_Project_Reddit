I have been diagnosed with some OCD symptoms, but other than that, I exhibit no &amp;quot;abnormal&amp;quot; traits, and consequently most of my friends do not know that often, I am in a lot of pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to this school to get away from home, and this decision was supported by my doctors. First year, I ran through some obstacles, but overall, my grades were alright. I made new friends, the dean of engineering supported me (he ended up knowing of my depression), and although both semesters were hard, I would say that I did a good job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sophomore year, I also dealt with pain, but I had developed more ways to get rid of it. I had joined the dodgeball club, several intramural teams, and worked on a math conjecture which I later proved, which I was told needed graduate level work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went through a variety of small situations in college, which I will not go into detail. It is universally agreed and seen that I have not made an attempt to hurt anyone or myself, nor have I made a threat to anyone or my own life. No fights, no animosity between me and teachers, nothing. I have spoken of being in a lot of pain, and one response to me disclosing this to professionals, which I now know is controversial, was to encourage me to go to a ward. I kept repeating that I thought it was a bad idea, but I finally gave in, and the result was terrible. I missed my classes, I was in a place where I was not allowed any homework or devices, and I felt separated from my friends. And I came to realize that the school may be playing a game to get me to leave. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although I made many friends that see a happier, kind of smart guy who seems great to hang out with, I sought help with very close friends who were really extraordinary people who support me as I type this. I talked about my depression with these people, and they supported me, and we shared a common goal of me recovering to a much happier, less anxious person. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of these friends confided in someone from the staff that she was worried about me. She meant no harm by it, and was possibly optimistic that the person might help. The response, which she forwards back to me was to cut off all communication with me. This is from someone (the faculty member) who knows one thing about me- that I am depressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Time goes on, and I make it through freshman year. It was tough, but I know that staying close or at home would slowly break me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forwarding through sophomore year, to the end of the first semester. I got sick, which prevents from exercising. I depend on exercise to relieve stress and I am in fantastic shape as a result. Strike 1. Then, because I was sick, I was in too much pain to sleep. So I didn&amp;#39;t sleep for a whole night. Strike 2. Then I got drunk. Strike 3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I was drunk, I expressed suicidal thoughts. I was crying out for help, saying that I was in a lot of pain. Fast forward after that, since the next information will make the stuff in between not very helpful, and we have the student conduct board determining it was okay for me to go back. They were super kind, and the last call I had with them was very comforting with them. I met with my psychiatrist and told him everything, and he agreed I was ready to go back to school. Things weren&amp;#39;t great, but they were easier. I was abused by security guards in the hospital they took me to(whole nuther story) and I was still trying to recover. Friends who were worried about me expressed their hope for my well-being. A teachers were happy when I told them I was allowed to go back, with all of them being very supportive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is important to keep in mind that, because of fear of something unfair happening, I keep my depression almost entirely to myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now, I receive a call from the dean of student health and well-being that he wants me to leave. As simple as that. I tell him everything- that my parents think this is a bad idea, that professional opinion thinks its a fucking horrible idea, and that I have been studying hard to make up for the stuff I missed. He doesnt give a shit and insists on the meeting which has the chance to break me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of me sees this as a formality. He never explicitly stated that I will have to leave, and merely encouraged it at first. He says he will contact a third party evaluator to check on me, and this kind of comforts me cause if this person isn&amp;#39;t from the school, I can easily convince him/her that a) I am not going to be in that situation again because I will never drink again b)that leaving the school with my closest friends and losing my courses there will leave me in a terrible state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up doing research and I learn that these meetings end up being one-sided. I did more research, and I see, given the situation, it violates the Americans with Disabilities Act on so many  levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I do not know what they could or will do, and I politely expressed my concern with the dean who called me that I am worried that this meeting is a scam trying to flush me out. Of course I did not use those words. What worries me is that this person will eagerly ignore medical professionals or my reasoning that this was a bad idea to go on with the meeting. He has an extremely small, if any, amount of evidence that shows me as someone who should leave. But I am worried of how corrupt this meeting is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can someone please help me? I&amp;#39;ve been feeling sick after hearing about this. I have gotten a lot of support from friends, which, in written form, plays a role in the meeting.
