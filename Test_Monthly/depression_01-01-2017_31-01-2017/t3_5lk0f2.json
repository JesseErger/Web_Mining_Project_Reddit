Like most of you, I have no one to talk to either. I certainly have no friends and haven&amp;#39;t for a very long time, but I do have a family that loves me and even a wife. But I can&amp;#39;t talk to them. See, my family doesn&amp;#39;t understand the depths of my depression and I certainly can&amp;#39;t explain it. Words fall short, tears choke out the ones I do try. No one knows me. My wife does, better than anyone else, but no one really knows. She&amp;#39;s asleep on the couch right now cause we had another fight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My depression has been extremely severe for the last year, and the past couple months it has really been spiraling beyond my control. My anger and irritability are off the charts. I can&amp;#39;t eat, but I&amp;#39;m starving. I&amp;#39;m so tired, but I can&amp;#39;t sleep. I feel like every moment of my life is just spent suffering, waiting and wondering when it will all finally end. I just keep praying I&amp;#39;ll die in an accident so I can be at peace without having to feel guilty for hurting the people who love me. I never leave my house anymore, I can&amp;#39;t go into grocery stores or gas stations because I can&amp;#39;t bare to interact with people. I can&amp;#39;t work because the depression is so debilitating. Ive started having panic attacks and extreme social anxiety. I feel like no one likes me and I don&amp;#39;t blame them. I hate myself, I hate having this severe depression, I hate what it does to me and the people I care for, I hate that it makes me useless. I would give anything to just be normal. I want to function like a normal person who can shower and go get groceries and talk to people and feel ok and work and contribute something. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyday I wake up, I sit in my house all alone all day long staring at the walls and trapped in my own head, then I try to sleep again.

They did an MRI of my brain with and without contrast on the 28th and I am waiting for the results. I feel that I must have a brain tumor or something.

That&amp;#39;s why I don&amp;#39;t understand why my depression has gotten so bad right now. I&amp;#39;ve been depressed officially since I was 17 but the first time I tried to kill myself I was in the third grade.

I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s an easy fix for that.\nI&amp;#39;m introverted too, and I prefer being alone, and even though sometimes I feel like that loneliness is oppressive, for the most part I enjoy it. But if you do need that human contact it&amp;#39;s hard to find because speaking to loads of people or trying to connect with lots of people is just too exhausting for us. My only advice is to pick your battles, find someone (even if it means waiting) that experiences the world a little like you do and try and connect with them.\nI have to admit, I laughed out loud at &amp;#39;bathe daily&amp;#39; because I&amp;#39;ve had the EXACT argument with someone before: \nWhat are you going to do today?\nNothing.\nCan you at least fucking shower for once!?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me it&amp;#39;s routine. Routine routine routine. Once I get into a routine of doing things I do them regardless of how I feel. The difficult thing is to get started, but one you do the whole process becomes so rote that your feelings don&amp;#39;t factor into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "depression", "name": "t1_dbwbiiw", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/5lk0f2/how_to_be_normal/dbwbiiw/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483372606.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483343806.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbwb7bu", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Whiteblazed", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dbwb14z", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I appreciate your post.
