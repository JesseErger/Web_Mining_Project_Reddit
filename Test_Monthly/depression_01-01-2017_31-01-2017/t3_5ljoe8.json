First of all i fucken love watching twitch streams in bed I watch league of legends what about you? (: , have been doing this for the past 5 years now at first it started off positive no negative vibes, but now its what i do to deal with the pain of being awake or dealing with the anxiety of not being able to leave my house and walk out the front door or untill i can doze off at some ridiculous hour. \n\nIt sounds like to me that you are experiencing depression, this can be caused by a number of things but you will have a better idea of what then me. I will start by saying that there are a number of small things that you can do to further help yourself one step at a time.\n\nFirst of all you need to stop eating shit food, i know its easy and tasty but cut it out it's not gonna help you on your road to recovery. thats fine if you can only eat a small amount but PLEASE make it real food like fruit or vegetables, nothing too carby.\n\nSecond of all is to do some sort of exercise, I know your situation and its fucken hard believe me Ive been experiencing this for years now and no one is gonna help you , if you cant help yourself! All you have to do is go for a 10-15 minute walk, let your thoughts run through your mind. you need to strengthen your muscles retrain them to where they once were at. even if you come back and you feel tired thats fine, take a nap you will feel better mentally for going out , trust me! I even found hill running to cure alot of my depression.. i would sit at work googling running techniques, \"how running cured my depression\" and it's amazing! but ill stop ranting about that. \n\nthird thing is to start doing some strecthing, just youtube yoga lower body back pain, something like that you will find you are getting pain in your legs because the muscles are becoming weak and they are picking up extra slack, an imbalance in the body in other words. a foam roller has saved me for many years of just lying in bed for most days, and doing yoga ( 24 year old male) \n\nNow whatever you are thinking about your life, it is not bad at all. this is the part of the process were you can prevent alot of negative things happening as long as you are pro active in noticing these changes and dealing with them one step at a time. Both my parents passed away at a young age, my brother committed suicide in novemeber and turned my world upside down. I have been mostly a pot head since i was 14 am 24 now. it's better to get help while you can and please take my advice seriously because all i can say is when i was your age and i was starting to feel symptoms like this, it is no where near as bad as what i am feeling on a daily basis now. my god if i could turn back the time to experience the 19 y/o me depression trust me i would. but I am not giving up, i am striving to feel that pleasure from daily life that I once felt a long time ago. you are loved by more people then you can think. please get help! do not be afraid to say your thoughts, but remember this you will benefit from natural ways of healing then taking meds believe me, my aunty is a pharmacist and i flew to asia from New Zealand to get Valium to deal with my head after my brothers passing.. hope this helps.\n\nLots of love xoxoxoxo", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can relate to this too.. First of all i fucken love watching twitch streams in bed I watch league of legends what about you? (: , have been doing this for the past 5 years now at first it started off positive no negative vibes, but now its what i do to deal with the pain of being awake or dealing with the anxiety of not being able to leave my house and walk out the front door or untill i can doze off at some ridiculous hour. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sounds like to me that you are experiencing depression, this can be caused by a number of things but you will have a better idea of what then me. I will start by saying that there are a number of small things that you can do to further help yourself one step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all you need to stop eating shit food, i know its easy and tasty but cut it out it&amp;#39;s not gonna help you on your road to recovery. thats fine if you can only eat a small amount but PLEASE make it real food like fruit or vegetables, nothing too carby.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second of all is to do some sort of exercise, I know your situation and its fucken hard believe me Ive been experiencing this for years now and no one is gonna help you , if you cant help yourself! All you have to do is go for a 10-15 minute walk, let your thoughts run through your mind. you need to strengthen your muscles retrain them to where they once were at. even if you come back and you feel tired thats fine, take a nap you will feel better mentally for going out , trust me! I even found hill running to cure alot of my depression.. i would sit at work googling running techniques, &amp;quot;how running cured my depression&amp;quot; and it&amp;#39;s amazing! but ill stop ranting about that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;third thing is to start doing some strecthing, just youtube yoga lower body back pain, something like that you will find you are getting pain in your legs because the muscles are becoming weak and they are picking up extra slack, an imbalance in the body in other words. a foam roller has saved me for many years of just lying in bed for most days, and doing yoga ( 24 year old male) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now whatever you are thinking about your life, it is not bad at all. this is the part of the process were you can prevent alot of negative things happening as long as you are pro active in noticing these changes and dealing with them one step at a time. Both my parents passed away at a young age, my brother committed suicide in novemeber and turned my world upside down. I have been mostly a pot head since i was 14 am 24 now. it&amp;#39;s better to get help while you can and please take my advice seriously because all i can say is when i was your age and i was starting to feel symptoms like this, it is no where near as bad as what i am feeling on a daily basis now. my god if i could turn back the time to experience the 19 y/o me depression trust me i would. but I am not giving up, i am striving to feel that pleasure from daily life that I once felt a long time ago. you are loved by more people then you can think. please get help! do not be afraid to say your thoughts, but remember this you will benefit from natural ways of healing then taking meds believe me, my aunty is a pharmacist and i flew to asia from New Zealand to get Valium to deal with my head after my brothers passing.. hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lots of love xoxoxoxo&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "depression", "name": "t1_dbwp6vt", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/5ljoe8/am_i_truly_depressed_or_just_lazy/dbwp6vt/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483405725.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483376925.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}]
