And I know new year new me is BS but I&amp;#39;m really trying to get my shit together this year and be productive but some things always pull me down. Right now I&amp;#39;ve cut off every so called friend of mine who was close to me when I started &amp;#39;16 because I kind of hated how less people valued me and how much they used me. But for a start, I feel really good about cutting them off and moving forward even though that means I&amp;#39;m alone, I&amp;#39;m trying to use this time to start appreciating my life more and maybe meet new, less toxic, people. But with all the me time, I tend to think a lot. And most of the thoughts are negative. First off, I kind off hate my body and I can get really conscious about it around people and depressed when I think of it.  Starting from bottom, I am a bit knock kneed that makes my walk different, people keep telling me why I walk like that and the more they say the more conscious I get when I walk towards someone or a group. Having knock knees, I&amp;#39;m really uncomfortable when I wear any kinds of shorts or skinny pants since it&amp;#39;s really visible then. After that, I have minor gynecomastia (puffy nipples) which makes my chest look less manly and fat. I can&amp;#39;t even take off my shirt without getting uncomfortable af. Then I have a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa. I get lumps under my armpits and groin area . These can be painful and give a bad odour. The lumps can also drain pus and blood which can easily show up on my tshirts or undergarments. I have an overbite which makes my chin looks weak and the whole face unsymmetrical. I also have weird shaped fingers which actually don&amp;#39;t hinder anything but people just notice and often make fun of &amp;#39;em. Hell I cant even go bald if I want to because my head is not even round because how I slept as a baby. \nI have asthma as well and it just wont go away. I&amp;#39;ve to take my inhaler almost daily. \nYes I&amp;#39;ve been hitting gym and people have been complimenting the muscles I have put on but all the problems that I have, they&amp;#39;re not fixable (some of them can be fixed by surgery but they&amp;#39;re costly) and it kinda depresses me thinking why out of all people, I have all of these things. I&amp;#39;ve never been happy of my body and I dont know how to cope with it and since I dont have many people to talk to I cant help but think about it over and over again facing the mirror or the other time I&amp;#39;m thinking why people do me dirty and why I can&amp;#39;t have strong social bonds. Also the fact that I have achieved nothing in my life so far and have been mediocre at everything I have done doesn&amp;#39;t help as well.\nAll this usually puts me in a bad mood and outweighs all the positive thoughts that I try to bring.
