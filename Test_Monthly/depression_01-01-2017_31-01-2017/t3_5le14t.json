All of which I was extremely close to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like an outcast at my job and pretty much anywhere else I go but I act as normal as you could define anyone as &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; would act. I try to treat anyone I come across with nothing but kindness and hate to see someone get mistreated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But seriously, to continue with my sloppily organized post about how this negativity is ruining my life, I don&amp;#39;t have my life even 1% figured out. I&amp;#39;m 21 which is a young age to have anything at all figured out but as I look around all I see are my friends getting engaged or getting these big job offers that they&amp;#39;ve always dreamed of. Some of them are also getting excepted into their dream schools to do what they&amp;#39;ve always dreamed of. One of my used to be closest friends got accepted into a school in Atlanta that will score him a place in TNA which will therefore most likely lead him into WWE. Yeah yeah it&amp;#39;s fake and blah blah blah but it&amp;#39;s what he wants to do and I&amp;#39;ve been supportive of him. I work at Lowe&amp;#39;s, it&amp;#39;s a very loving job and I love the people I work with most of the time, I don&amp;#39;t feel like it&amp;#39;s enough though. I don&amp;#39;t feel like I living up to what I can be, but I don&amp;#39;t know what I can/should be doing. Not a damn clue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve spent most of my last 6 months alone ever since my aunt died. I&amp;#39;m just very unsocial and it&amp;#39;s extremely difficult for me to make new friends. I&amp;#39;m also not one to go and party (alcohol, weed, etc) because it&amp;#39;s just not me. Everyone around me is that way and they&amp;#39;re even getting into harder drugs. Yes this is the people I work with. My past relationships have both ended because of them cheating on me. I just don&amp;#39;t really know what&amp;#39;s wrong with me or if I push people away from me for a reason?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m trying to say is that as I look at my friends having a blast on new years eve/day with their families, I sit here with tears in my eyes because I feel like I have no one. I feel very unloved and very unwanted. I just feel like that 2017 is going to be a long year spent as a loner because I just don&amp;#39;t appeal to anyone and I don&amp;#39;t have anyone to go out and do anything with to meet more people. I don&amp;#39;t want to invite myself into peoples&amp;#39; plans and I don&amp;#39;t want to invite them to do anything because rejection is pretty common for me. I trapped in a very dark place and finding the light seems impossible for me. Someone please help me.
