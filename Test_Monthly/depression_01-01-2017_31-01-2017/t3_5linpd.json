I was that guy you hated. I was him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I had a sinus infection. My life was fucked over by a sinus infection. I wish I was joking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I didn\u2019t exactly know I had a sinus infection. The doctors didn\u2019t know either:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I vomited multiple times a day; I suffered from extensive head aches; I felt broken because no one knew what was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw gastroenterologists because of the vomiting.

Basically, in short, the antibiotics fucked over my digestive system and created very fun trips to the potty. It lasted for a while. One complication over another. My body was compromised and malnourished. I was getting close to looking like a skeleton (I just read over everything I have written so far, and realized I missed a ton of things. Let\u2019s just say it ended up a lot worse than how I described it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This all happened over a period of 323 days (I started counting at day 3). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I attempted to step back into school and failed miserably. I now had social anxiety because of a few obvious reasons. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lost my hobbies, my friends, my girlfriend, and myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overtime, the anxiety led to me learning and \u2018doing school\u2019 from home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being socially isolated led to depression. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seriously, the tumor would have been better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let\u2019s skip through the nasties of depression (this is a subreddit about depression, I\u2019m sure we don\u2019t need a review). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came out the other side of the long and dark tunnel into another long and dark tunnel. I had treatment resistant depression (I\u2019ve seen multiple psychotherapists and tried almost every type of cocktail they could throw at me). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I continued finishing up my high school career with a clouded mind. I was depressed all the time (anxiety gone, thank god). I couldn\u2019t focus on anything. I had no energy to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let\u2019s hop to the last two months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked for adderall to just help me focus on my school work so I could just keep moving on (until I figured out how I wanted to end things with myself).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adderall\u2026 ADHD\u2026? Nope! Adderall = Treatment resistant depression!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No joke. The adderall gave me energy. It gave me life. It helped my focus on what is ahead of me.
