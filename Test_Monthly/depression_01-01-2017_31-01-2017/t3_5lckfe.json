Thinking to myself, \"No, that's a shit way to start.\" or \"What if someone I know recognized my username and started mocking me about what I was saying.\"\nEven as I write this, I think to myself, \"Why would anyone be interested in what you have to say?\" or the one time m dad told me, (Once was all he needed) \"Man up.\" And with that I think to myself \"Guys shouldn't cry\" or \"Guys don't talk about feelings and get emotional.\"\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I understand the inferiority that you feel. The feeling of \"I need to be the best at everything, or I am nothing.\" Now, I'm not going to say that I know exactly what you are going through because I don't. I also don't want to sound like I have it worse therefore you shouldn't have anything to complain about. (I've had people say to me plenty of times that they understand what I'm going through and all that crap, but when I ask them to describe it they either can't or just repeat what I said to them. I've also had people try to \"one up\" my issues like a fucking game to see who's life is shittier and who should shut up because the other has it worse. Either that or they just straight up tell me, \"There are others who have it worse than you.\" and I hate it more than anything so it's the last thing I would want to do to someone else.)\n\nI recently graduated from high school and I am living at my parents house still, I constantly think to myself everyday, \"Look at you, sitting here day after day, playing games watching movies and browsing the internet. Useless.\", \"You don't have a job, nor do you help around the house hardly ever. You just sit here wasting everyone's time and money.\"\n\nMy best friend from when I stared school up to when I got to high school was great. We did everything together whenever we could. It was great. When we got to high school however, I started to talk to him about certain things that bothered me or that I was struggling with. He started to \"one up\" me one shitty things that happened to him and didn't care about my problems at all. Once he got a group of friends who liked to smoke, drink, skate, steal etc. He only ever called me if all of his other friends were busy. And stupid me, I would always oblige thinking that maybe one day he would actually enjoy my company again.\nI started to think that he never actually wanted me around even when we were younger. Just the thought that someone could just dump a friend off like that after 6-7 years like nothing infuriated me, and killed me. The possibility that I was just \"filler\" that whole time was absolutely heartbreaking to me.\nFrom then on, I tried to fit in the best I could with whoever I could. Even if we had nothing in common I, just wanted people to appreciate me, for real this time. So I started to try to be the best at everything. If someone liked sports, I had to be the best at that so they might accept me, did they appreciate someone with good grades? Had to be the best at that too.\nI started to hang around with people I didn't even like just to be accepted, constantly worrying that they would just leave me in the blink of an eye. Through the years I found some friends that I actually liked to be around and felt (reasonably) comfortable with. But they always moved away.\n\nIt had started my obsession with being someone I wasn't. It was who I was now. I can't even remember how it felt to be me. My thoughts are always scattered and fragmented and there are times when I literally can't form thoughts that even make sense to me. Trying to speak to people is difficult because I have no idea what to say or even how to say it because I'm trying to think of what they want to hear rather than what I would say.\nI am so distracted with trying to fit in, I literally don't know what kind of person I am.\nAm I nice?\nAm I loud?\nAm I annoying?\nAm I thoughtful?\n\nAll of the shit I've had thrown at me used to make me sad and lonely and that became a normal feeling. Recently, it's been either I feel nothing or I feel hatred towards anything, everything. Hatred, thinking that I deserve all of this, but why? What the actual fuck did I do to feel like this.\n\nMost of my hatred however is directed at god (if there is one). My mom is religious and so took me to church when I was younger. Didn't think to much on the concept of god mostly because the people attending that church were all cunts so I just assumed that all Christians were that way. Later though about half way through high school, I thought I found my \"salvation\" so to speak. I had found people that I really enjoyed being around (still nervous around though). It was a youth group organized through two churches, one nearby and one out of town. It was a small group of people who I could have thoughtful conversations with. It was the only thing really worth living for. I thought to myself, \"If this is what being a christian is all about, count me in.\" I would pray to god go to church, the works. After a few months, however, most of the people there had graduated and moved off to University or College and the majority of the group was replaced with a bunch of loud, annoying 10-14 year olds.\nI was utterly destroyed yet again. It was all back to normal now. I started to blame god for everything, started to build up all of my hatred towards everything. I've built up so much hatred for god and life that I get so unbelievably angry at everything that annoys me. Now the only thing that makes me even remotely happy is the escape that games provide. It's not enough but it's something.\n\nEvery time something goes wrong in game (aside from if an enemy kills me or something) I get infuriated. For example if my internet is suddenly slow and I can't play a game that requires internet connection or if my game crashes I get so angry it's ridiculous sometimes leading to fits of rage telling god to die. I think the reason is that, I feel as though god has taken so much from me including my entire personality that I have to feel protective of what Good thing I have left. That being games.\n\nI'm sorry this got a little off track from my original statement about relating to your sense of inferiority compared to others. Sorry if this seems like more of a rant than anything. I hope you could follow all of it without much difficulty. Like I said, it's been difficult for me to even form sensible thoughts never mind explaining something to someone else.\n\nI'm also not sure how this would help in anyway, but I felt the need to post here.\n\nEdit: Sorry for the wall of text too.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been sitting here for around an hour now, wondering how in the world I was going to start this comment. Thinking to myself, &amp;quot;No, that&amp;#39;s a shit way to start.&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;What if someone I know recognized my username and started mocking me about what I was saying.&amp;quot;\nEven as I write this, I think to myself, &amp;quot;Why would anyone be interested in what you have to say?&amp;quot; or the one time m dad told me, (Once was all he needed) &amp;quot;Man up.&amp;quot; And with that I think to myself &amp;quot;Guys shouldn&amp;#39;t cry&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Guys don&amp;#39;t talk about feelings and get emotional.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess what I&amp;#39;m trying to say is that I understand the inferiority that you feel. The feeling of &amp;quot;I need to be the best at everything, or I am nothing.&amp;quot; Now, I&amp;#39;m not going to say that I know exactly what you are going through because I don&amp;#39;t. I also don&amp;#39;t want to sound like I have it worse therefore you shouldn&amp;#39;t have anything to complain about. (I&amp;#39;ve had people say to me plenty of times that they understand what I&amp;#39;m going through and all that crap, but when I ask them to describe it they either can&amp;#39;t or just repeat what I said to them. I&amp;#39;ve also had people try to &amp;quot;one up&amp;quot; my issues like a fucking game to see who&amp;#39;s life is shittier and who should shut up because the other has it worse. Either that or they just straight up tell me, &amp;quot;There are others who have it worse than you.&amp;quot; and I hate it more than anything so it&amp;#39;s the last thing I would want to do to someone else.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recently graduated from high school and I am living at my parents house still, I constantly think to myself everyday, &amp;quot;Look at you, sitting here day after day, playing games watching movies and browsing the internet. Useless.&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t have a job, nor do you help around the house hardly ever. You just sit here wasting everyone&amp;#39;s time and money.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My best friend from when I stared school up to when I got to high school was great. We did everything together whenever we could. It was great. When we got to high school however, I started to talk to him about certain things that bothered me or that I was struggling with. He started to &amp;quot;one up&amp;quot; me one shitty things that happened to him and didn&amp;#39;t care about my problems at all. Once he got a group of friends who liked to smoke, drink, skate, steal etc. He only ever called me if all of his other friends were busy. And stupid me, I would always oblige thinking that maybe one day he would actually enjoy my company again.\nI started to think that he never actually wanted me around even when we were younger. Just the thought that someone could just dump a friend off like that after 6-7 years like nothing infuriated me, and killed me. The possibility that I was just &amp;quot;filler&amp;quot; that whole time was absolutely heartbreaking to me.\nFrom then on, I tried to fit in the best I could with whoever I could. Even if we had nothing in common I, just wanted people to appreciate me, for real this time. So I started to try to be the best at everything. If someone liked sports, I had to be the best at that so they might accept me, did they appreciate someone with good grades? Had to be the best at that too.\nI started to hang around with people I didn&amp;#39;t even like just to be accepted, constantly worrying that they would just leave me in the blink of an eye. Through the years I found some friends that I actually liked to be around and felt (reasonably) comfortable with. But they always moved away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It had started my obsession with being someone I wasn&amp;#39;t. It was who I was now. I can&amp;#39;t even remember how it felt to be me. My thoughts are always scattered and fragmented and there are times when I literally can&amp;#39;t form thoughts that even make sense to me. Trying to speak to people is difficult because I have no idea what to say or even how to say it because I&amp;#39;m trying to think of what they want to hear rather than what I would say.\nI am so distracted with trying to fit in, I literally don&amp;#39;t know what kind of person I am.\nAm I nice?\nAm I loud?\nAm I annoying?\nAm I thoughtful?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of the shit I&amp;#39;ve had thrown at me used to make me sad and lonely and that became a normal feeling. Recently, it&amp;#39;s been either I feel nothing or I feel hatred towards anything, everything. Hatred, thinking that I deserve all of this, but why? What the actual fuck did I do to feel like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of my hatred however is directed at god (if there is one). My mom is religious and so took me to church when I was younger. Didn&amp;#39;t think to much on the concept of god mostly because the people attending that church were all cunts so I just assumed that all Christians were that way. Later though about half way through high school, I thought I found my &amp;quot;salvation&amp;quot; so to speak. I had found people that I really enjoyed being around (still nervous around though). It was a youth group organized through two churches, one nearby and one out of town. It was a small group of people who I could have thoughtful conversations with. It was the only thing really worth living for. I thought to myself, &amp;quot;If this is what being a christian is all about, count me in.&amp;quot; I would pray to god go to church, the works. After a few months, however, most of the people there had graduated and moved off to University or College and the majority of the group was replaced with a bunch of loud, annoying 10-14 year olds.\nI was utterly destroyed yet again. It was all back to normal now. I started to blame god for everything, started to build up all of my hatred towards everything. I&amp;#39;ve built up so much hatred for god and life that I get so unbelievably angry at everything that annoys me. Now the only thing that makes me even remotely happy is the escape that games provide. It&amp;#39;s not enough but it&amp;#39;s something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every time something goes wrong in game (aside from if an enemy kills me or something) I get infuriated. For example if my internet is suddenly slow and I can&amp;#39;t play a game that requires internet connection or if my game crashes I get so angry it&amp;#39;s ridiculous sometimes leading to fits of rage telling god to die. I think the reason is that, I feel as though god has taken so much from me including my entire personality that I have to feel protective of what Good thing I have left. That being games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry this got a little off track from my original statement about relating to your sense of inferiority compared to others.
