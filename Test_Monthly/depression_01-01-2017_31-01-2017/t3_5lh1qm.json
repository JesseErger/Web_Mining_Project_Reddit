contact and just rest in myself, yesterday some girl sat right next to me on an almost empty bus, and when i wanted to go out she smiled to me, and another day i was having a fun time talking with a girl at my friends house(also high at the moment).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When i&amp;#39;m high i feel like i am my true self without a barrier trying to protect me from people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some days i am happy and i want to go out and meet people(not very often but sometimes) and other days i am literally scared of everything waiting outside my door&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am speaking with an psychologist at the moment, which is really good for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i am taking antidepressiv in a small dose, and i have daily suicide
