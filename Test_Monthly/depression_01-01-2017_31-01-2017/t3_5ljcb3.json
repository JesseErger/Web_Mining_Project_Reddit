I&amp;#39;ve been in my new job for a little over 5 months and over the last month or so my symptoms have worsened pretty severely. The job is technical fault/support in a call centre for a major tv and internet provider. Initially things were really good, having a routine was really helping and I was making mental improvements.

Kinda came to a head a few days ago when a customer called me useless and told me I was doing a &amp;#39;piss poor job&amp;#39; - among other swearing and insults - even though his issue wasn&amp;#39;t actually anything to do with my role or even my company, really. I know I&amp;#39;m doing a decent job - my manager and stats both say so - but I keep replaying this conversation over and over in my head and I can&amp;#39;t shake it. I&amp;#39;m royally fed up of being spoken to like shit over things I cannot control. I&amp;#39;m waking up and I&amp;#39;m nearly in tears before every shift. It feels like this may be the worst I&amp;#39;ve been in years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, if I decide to leave this job I have to give a months notice, which means I have no idea how I&amp;#39;m supposed to look for something else if I&amp;#39;m unable to start for another month. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really have no idea what to do.
