Which has account for more than $300 total. He also stole my friends juul (an e-cig), he won&amp;#39;t admit to it and of course wouldn&amp;#39;t buy him a new one and/ or give it back. The other roommate is very stingy with money, so of course, the generous person I am, I bought him a new one.

Of course, at the end of the trip, flying home, I stuck it in my front right pocket and somehow it ended up gone. I always check the seat pocket in front of me and my seat after flying.
