I don&amp;#39;t know how to stop caring about what they think, because right now, they&amp;#39;re all I&amp;#39;ve got. I don&amp;#39;t really have any good friends who will talk to me about life situations without tuning out, or ignoring me. I&amp;#39;ve never dealt with difficult life situations like this before, and I need all the support I can get. I try to do all the right things, all the time, and I can&amp;#39;t please them or make them happy. Nothing is ever good enough.
