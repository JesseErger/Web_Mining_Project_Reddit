No matter how hard I try, everything turns out wrong. I leave home at 7:40 AM and comeback home at 1:00 AM and during that time I study, study, and study. But my grades are not getting any better.

I punched my thighs so hard during classes to keep myself awake and since then there are always bruises all over my thighs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think my depression started because I was lacking of affection. MY mother always wanted more and I couldn&amp;#39;t give her what she wanted. She never encouraged me but scolded me because she thought I was not trying my best. She wanted me to be awake until 12:AM so I study like every other sons and daughters of my mother&amp;#39;s friend but I couldn&amp;#39;t. So I had to stand up and study in front of my mother. At school I took depression test (My middle school made me do that every year) and obviously my test&amp;#39;s result said I have very low self esteem and I am suffering from depression. My mother found the paper and asked me about it and I could clearly see disgust in her eyes so I had to tell her I misread the questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked my friends for help at 2013 and my mother got so embarrassed about the fact I want to die so bad and I told others about that. And she screamed at me because I made her embarrassed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2014 I took depression test again and my teacher helped me a lot. He offered my mother to make me meet the counselor. My father disagreed, claiming everyone gets moody sometimes and I am acting like a baby. (But he never treated me like a baby nor child. I had to do everything by myself since my parents were busy taking care of my younger sister.) And my mother supported me for few months until my father told my mother it was a waste of money.
