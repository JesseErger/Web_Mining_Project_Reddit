I tried to help him, I let him treat me like shit, I stood by him when nobody else did, I was his only friend. The only reason I stuck around as long as I did is because he was the only person in the world who I could be myself around, my true self. When I spent time with him, the world felt shiny and new again, nothing was impossible, and life was an adventure. Two years ago though he fell off the wagon again after having been sober a while. He started being cruel to me, really tried to tear me down as a person despite me being his only real ally and friend. I finally cut ties with him and told him to fuck off. Fast forward to 10 months ago and he hurt some people real bad while fucked up on who knows what. His trial is in a few weeks.
