I hit the power button. Screen flashes, bios splash page... still bios splash page... 30 seconds pass and I'm still staring at the splash page, and I'm legitimately starting to have a panic attack. Eventually, the screen blinks again and I let out a sigh of relief only to be met with the most horrifying sound and visuals I've ever experienced... the computer passing the post and the bios splash page greeting me again. I sat terrified. I thought my machine was bricked and watching it cycle over and over again and I started figuring out how to recover the data from the hard disk. But before I do all that, I decided to reset all the settings on the bios. If that doesn't work, I figure I can pull the bios battery, after that I start crying for help.\n\nI reset the bios through the interface and what felt like the longest post to bios splash to blank screen passed before my eyes. I'm sweating (I still had a slight fever to be fair). Finally, the OS booted and was able to get in. I backed up everything and finished the project today (I was that close...).

I have to hard-kill it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now before I go any further, you should know. I&amp;#39;ve been engaging for weeks in horrible practices. I had no version control. Now before you burn me at the stake, I pushed genuinely hard for my current project to have some version control but because of time contraints I was asked by my boss to forgo worrying about version control in favor of doing it all locally as quickly as can be (he&amp;#39;s really not normally like this). &lt;em&gt;No problem, I&amp;#39;ll do remote backups of the code at least&lt;/em&gt;. I held true for some time, but miss-a-day here, miss-a-few-days there, and as I&amp;#39;m watching my computer completely shit the bed I realized it&amp;#39;s been over three weeks since I&amp;#39;ve backed it up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, faced with either hard rebooting or not having an operational computer. I hit the power button. Screen flashes, bios splash page... still bios splash page... 30 seconds pass and I&amp;#39;m still staring at the splash page, and I&amp;#39;m legitimately starting to have a panic attack. Eventually, the screen blinks again and I let out a sigh of relief only to be met with the most horrifying sound and visuals I&amp;#39;ve ever experienced... the computer passing the post and the bios splash page greeting me again. I sat terrified. I thought my machine was bricked and watching it cycle over and over again and I started figuring out how to recover the data from the hard disk. But before I do all that, I decided to reset all the settings on the bios. If that doesn&amp;#39;t work, I figure I can pull the bios battery, after that I start crying for help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I reset the bios through the interface and what felt like the longest post to bios splash to blank screen passed before my eyes. I&amp;#39;m sweating (I still had a slight fever to be fair). Finally, the OS booted and was able to get in. I backed up everything and finished the project today (I was that close...).  Monday, the first thing I&amp;#39;m doing to set it up on our git and NEVER DOING THAT AGAIN!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "ProgrammerHumor",
