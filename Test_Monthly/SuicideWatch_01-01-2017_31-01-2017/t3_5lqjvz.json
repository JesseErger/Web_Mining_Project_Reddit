That&amp;#39;s not completely my problem. Recently I&amp;#39;ve been feeling so numb to life and it&amp;#39;s to the point where I don&amp;#39;t see the point in living anymore. Thing is I&amp;#39;m afraid of dying. For a long time now I&amp;#39;ve been feeling alone and like I have no one in this life. People are the only thing that make life worth living. I&amp;#39;m not a shy or awkward guy but at this point I don&amp;#39;t have many friends in my life. Awhile ago due to uncanny luck I started working at the same job as a guy that I&amp;#39;ve liked since nineth grade. We also take classes together this year. I don&amp;#39;t know what I did but we somehow clicked and became close friends (not THE closest but close). He&amp;#39;s a feminine guy so there was a time when I thought he felt the same way but do to his homophobic remarks about other gay people and him showing me a lot of the messages from girls he&amp;#39;s been with (the normal guy thing I assume) I made an executive decision to back off of him in that way. However at this point in my life he is one of the only friends that I got and also (again despite us not being that close) the best friend I&amp;#39;ve got so I really don&amp;#39;t wanna lose him. It feels like lately we&amp;#39;ve been drifting apart despite my absolute best effort to be more talkative, be funnier, and at some times pulling away do to me feeling that I&amp;#39;ve been coming on too strong. Losing him is my worst fear in the world. Not only is he the best friend I have rn but he&amp;#39;s also a guy that I&amp;#39;ve liked for a long time now. It&amp;#39;s like because of my apathy towards life, my loneliness, and my lust for him combined he&amp;#39;s subliminally become my reason for living. I&amp;#39;ve been depressed for a while now and it&amp;#39;s a sad thing when you at an age as young as 13 are trying to decide what song you&amp;#39;re gonna kill yourself to. The only reason I&amp;#39;m still here today is because I promised myself that I would at least wait until the age of 27 to see if the shit about life getting better is true or not and I chose 27 because of Kurt Cobain. If I&amp;#39;m gonna die why not die with an artistic aesthetic in mind. However everyday I feel worse and worse and I thank my mom for being a responsible one and hiding her gun because idk if I&amp;#39;d be here today. With all that being said my question is this: Should I ask my mom to see a therapist/ psychologist or whatever? The reason I have to ask is because I fear my mom asking me and forcing me to tell her what I&amp;#39;m so upset about and I also fear not knowing what to tell the therapist and just wasting time and money or speaking too much and ending up in some kinda mental hospital. If not what should I do? The worst part about all of this is feeling like I don&amp;#39;t even have anyone (irl) to express my feelings of sadness to. I just feel like a dog in a cage and all I ever do is go to school, work, the come home and go to bed and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore. Am I just gonna be another gay statistic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Short Version (less details): I&amp;#39;m a southern bisexual but mostly gay kid who&amp;#39;s felt extremely lonely to the point of suicide for a long time now. I randomly by some stroke of luck became friends with a feminine guy who I&amp;#39;ve been enthralled with feeling for since 9th grade but found out he was straight. We&amp;#39;re slowly losing our bond and I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;ll do without him considering he is my only good friend at all rn. I&amp;#39;m feeling lonely, depressed and suicidal rn so should I ask my mom to see a therapist?
