I had every opportunity to open a YouTube tab and watch a documentary or learn something, but there was this... blockade. It felt hard. Something was stopping me.\n\nThe best description I can think of for this feeling is inactivity. You physically aren't doing anything. A lot of people ask, if you aren't doing anything, how can you be upset? You're not doing anything wrong!\n\n..When in reality the problem lies within the fact that you are inactive. You're not doing the things you love. For me, this was politics and speaking to people. I hopped on TS this week and spoke to my friends for a few hours and I had a blast, many laughs and smiles, we even played a few games together. I haven't done that in months. I haven't felt genuine happiness in months, either. \n\nAnother thing is not being rewarded. We, as people, crave recognition. That's true, and it's normal.

I get... a bit depressed.\" That quote right there probably applies to you.\n\nMy absolute best advice is be productive. Initiate in things. Make memories. It's so hard, and it will require more willpower than ever before, but it will be worth it - you will lift this blockade. *You, and you alone, will break the chains of negativity*. **Defeatism will not get to you.**\n\nOP, I am absolutely sure you have so much to live for.
