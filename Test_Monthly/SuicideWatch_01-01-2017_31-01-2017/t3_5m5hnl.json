If you read it, thanks for your time, if not, I don&amp;#39;t blame you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a mid-twenties guy, from the US and I think I&amp;#39;ve had really bad depression for a while. I never saw anyone or anything, but I&amp;#39;m pretty sure what I have is depression of some sort. I&amp;#39;m the kind of person who constantly way over-analyzes everything and I haven&amp;#39;t been even slightly happy in fucking years. I come from a large family (nine kids), but we&amp;#39;re very poor. Like, one notch above homelessness, real poverty, food stamps, saving coins for haircuts poor. Now full disclosure, my family is a fucking mess. My two younger brothers are still in high school, and of my younger sisters, one is living in the city going to school (druggie type girl with tattoos and shit), and the other two (one 17 the other 19) are working at a fast food place, saving no fucking money, and neither one has a high school diploma or GED. On top of that, my three older siblings are a fucking mess. They don&amp;#39;t like talking to my parents, they don&amp;#39;t want to help the home here and they all went off and said fuck all to everyone else. My parents, by the way, are generally good people and I commend them deeply for what they&amp;#39;ve done and what they&amp;#39;ve given up to be able to raise us all. But they fucking hate each other. They do now and they have for 30 fucking years. They used to yell at each other and fight and hate each other back when I was little, and they still do. As much as I understand as an adult the sacrifices they made, they are, without a doubt, two of the most irresponsible adults I&amp;#39;ve ever seen. I mean, the way I see it is: I shouldn&amp;#39;t even fucking exist at all. They had their first kid, my oldest brother, by accident out of wedlock, and decided they had to stay together. Then, without ever improving their circumstances (owning a home, better jobs, having savings), and without ever saving anything, or creating any kind of positive future for the fucking humans they were creating, they had kids. Eight more fucking times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With my family in context I&amp;#39;d like to tell you some more about myself, a year ago I was in the military. F/18 engine mechanic. Worst fucking job ever. I hated it more than anything. But I did that bullshit for 5 fucking years and got out. Like I said before, I come from a very poor family. So, while I was in I would get emails constantly asking for money for bills and things. It&amp;#39;s so embarrassing to even tell people this on here, but I did it. I sent home (more or less) between $900-$2000 a month, every fucking month for the better part of 5 years. The variance is only as I would get promoted, I&amp;#39;d be able to afford sending more when they asked, which was pretty much every fucking three weeks. Here&amp;#39;s the kicker. In the last year I was in, I had received an email asking for $2000 and I complied, but I sent a response saying that I won&amp;#39;t be sending anything else after this, because I&amp;#39;ll need to save something before I get out. (At this point I was starting to realize just maybe how bad a spot I&amp;#39;d put myself in). Barely two weeks later I got another email apologizing, and asking for money. I said hell no I need to save something before I get out or I&amp;#39;m gonna be broke and be fucked. JK, I remember sitting in my barracks room staring at the email for a solid thirty minutes, thinking. And then I sent the money. And I continued to send it. For those of you asking yourself, &amp;quot;why the fuck would this dumb ass send the fucking money? Say &amp;quot;fuck no&amp;quot; and move the fuck around&amp;quot;. From my point of view, and in my mind, I believed I was helping build something better back home. Help them close up some debt lines, maintain a livable status (for my parents and younger sisters/brothers) and generally keep everyone from losing it. I was wrong. They spent the money on bills /and/ on bullshit. The worst things is, the dream that I was building something better with financial help? Just a fucking dream. I came home after separation and the shit house I grew up in was even worse then I had left it. Debts hadn&amp;#39;t decreased, they&amp;#39;d actually fucking increased. On top of that the family now had a bigger rift among people then it ever did before. My older sister refuses to speak to my mom and sends her these super long texts saying she&amp;#39;s a terrible person and she hopes she dies and all kinds of shit (even unprovoked, I read a long ass message full of hateful shit she sent to my mother as a response to my mom texting her: &amp;quot;Badjokealready will be landing in the plane at this time, if you want to call him&amp;quot; when I was coming home. Wtf?). My oldest brother lives in LA and acts like the family doesn&amp;#39;t exist, my younger sister had become a druggie, gotten tatted up, and was selling drugs in the city (and she was hospitalized for two days or something for suicide watch after cutting herself on the thighs). My two younger sisters live out of my parents basement and say fuck all to everyone in the house. They say they don&amp;#39;t want to be a part of the family and they take advantage of everyone and are generally spiteful and rude throughout every fucking day. (it is so fucking annoying). Every aspect of the life here had gotten worse, not better. For those asking how I didn&amp;#39;t know any of this beforehand, I was overseas for the majority of my time in the military and I never took any leave to go home. So my coming back after separation was my first time home in five years, and it&amp;#39;s a fucking disaster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, about three years ago I started getting really sad all the time. I couldn&amp;#39;t figure out why. I didn&amp;#39;t feel like I felt anything really. I couldn&amp;#39;t enjoy myself, I found people to be more aggravating than ever (I&amp;#39;m usually a total people-person) and I was constantly exhausted and just generally &amp;quot;spacey&amp;quot; I guess. On top of that I started having these really vivid dreams and then really vivid nightmares. I mean like the kind of dreams and nightmares where you actually feel like you&amp;#39;re there. A bunch of times people who would be sleeping in the same room as me would wake me up because they would hear me crying in my sleep. I can&amp;#39;t remember a lot of the dreams and nightmares, but there are a bunch that I wrote down after waking from them and some I drew pictures of to make sure I&amp;#39;d remember. There was even recurring character&amp;#39;s and settings sometimes. I started, for a while at least, avoiding sleep because the nightmares were getting to me. I would avoid sleep until I couldn&amp;#39;t anymore and then usually I would fall asleep on the floor, usually fully clothed. There&amp;#39;s a bit more to this, but I&amp;#39;m going to keep it to myself. The possibilities of what certain things could mean worry me. But this is generally what happened 3 (may be 3 and a half) years ago and it&amp;#39;s when I started becoming depressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this is already super long so I&amp;#39;m going to wrap it up. Basically, I think I&amp;#39;m going to kill myself, I just don&amp;#39;t know when. I think about it constantly, all the fucking time. Everyday I wake up I&amp;#39;m thrust into an immediate existential crises. I don&amp;#39;t know what keeps people going. What keeps us going? I mean people can&amp;#39;t actually be satisfied being, basically, slaves, right? Look at us, only as free as our funds will allow us to be. For people with no talents or skill, no money or family, what&amp;#39;s the fucking point? I used to have this dialogue I read somewhere that I would say to people when they would ask me what the meaning of life is, it goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re talking about our biological life, I believe it&amp;#39;s pretty much pointless, because the notion that some squishy humans have some sort of grand cosmic purpose seems silly to me. Now that that&amp;#39;s covered I can talk about the meaning of our individual lives. On the basis that our lives won&amp;#39;t have very much significance /in the end/ individuals can find meaning in their lives by pondering what it is that they find meaningful. Of course, this will vary greatly among people because we all have very different experiences in life, which create different emotional memories, which are used to create a unique sense of what we find significant. What I mean to say, is that each of us will find meaning in our lives in a different way than everyone else. That being said, finding out what makes you feel happy and purposeful long enough to forget you&amp;#39;re sort of a biological computer, trapped in a sack of meat, is the meaning of life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I can&amp;#39;t even get behind that shit anymore. People become chained to all of these different aspects of their lives. Their job, car, house, ect. They&amp;#39;re not free. They can&amp;#39;t go see the world or enjoy nature or aspire to anything really great, because they&amp;#39;re surrounded by the fucking anchors of just being alive. Right? I think it&amp;#39;s still right, that people find their own meaning to life and that there is no grander purpose, but what if I can&amp;#39;t find meaning in my life? Or, even worse, what if the meaning in my life is to work some shit job (or may be what people would call a &amp;quot;good job&amp;quot;) to afford a shit life and toil, live and die average as fuck. I&amp;#39;m not okay with that. That&amp;#39;s the part I don&amp;#39;t understand about people. Why the fuck is everyone so &amp;quot;okay&amp;quot; with being average!? Why the fuck is everyone so content to settle!? Seriously, wtf!?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve come to hate people a lot and it&amp;#39;s ruined me, but I seriously don&amp;#39;t get it. I don&amp;#39;t get why I shouldn&amp;#39;t kill myself. I don&amp;#39;t understand why, if I&amp;#39;m just going to live average and unhappy for a whole fucking lifetime, why I shouldn&amp;#39;t just skip it. I don&amp;#39;t know, at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I may be wrong, for all I know, but I may be right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a lot more to write, but I&amp;#39;m pretty sure this is already so long that no one in their right mind will read this shit, so I&amp;#39;m going to leave it here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I don't really even know how to type this out to tell anyone on here, so I'm going to do the best I can and if it's shit, then sorry.\nAlso, sorry for the huge text wall.
