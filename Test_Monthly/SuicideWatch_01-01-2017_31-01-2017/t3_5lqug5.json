However, I would like to point out the significant feeling between *feeling* that people who actually support you, who care about you, are \"sick\" of you, and dating a girl who may *seem* unappreciative to you. I will explain the reason I use of italics in a moment.\n\nIn essence, people who support other people are always who care for them in one way or another. At the same time, it is literally impossible to be \"sick\" of someone and to support them at the same time. So although you may *feel* uncomfortable when you think of, or interact with, the people who support you, it doesn't mean that they feel the same way. Correct me if I am wrong, but I am assuming that it is you who feels uncomfortable around them, because if they were truly or actually \"sick\" of you, then they would not be supporting you.\n\nSomething to consider may be: How do you feel when you feel \"sick\" of someone? You feel annoyed, right?  Who is it that *seems* annoyed to you? Your girlfriend, correct?\n\nThe issue here, to me, seems to be that your girlfriend has been rather unappreciative of who you are, for one reason or another. Essentially, to you, she may *seem* annoyed, but to other people, to me, she might seem like she is emotionally abusing you, or is emotionally toxic. \n\nTo be perfectly honest, all romantic relationships should be based upon love, or at least, on attraction. And even though it is okay to have a disagreement with one's partner every now and then, to feel a little unhappy or displease with them, is a sign that *the person feeling annoyed* is doing something wrong. You might really like the girl, I can't blame you for not ending the relationship. However, annoyance is the opposite of emotional attraction. It is literally the opposite. And it certainly isn't love. Therefore, it seems to me that she is dating you because some ulterior motives, and I suspect that she may feel good about herself by causing you to feel bad about yourself. Essentially, as she pushes you down so to speak, she may feel as though she is pushing herself up. That is the definition of a toxic person.\n\nEven though there is no shame in loving any girl, I suspect that much of your emotional distress has to do with the girl that you are dating. It seems to me that she has caused you to *feel* as though you are not good enough for her, as though you are not worthy. That *feeling* of unworthiness, not actual \"unworthiness, just the feeling of it, may have caused you to feel that people who obviously care about you, are \"sick\" of you, or annoyed, just like the girl who you are dating *seems* to be. Those people who support you, are obviously not annoyed by you because they are supporting you. They care for you. They think that you are more than worthy of support, of help, and of care. All the people on this thread also care about you, about supporting you otherwise we would not be writing to you.\n\nI may have generalized a bit or missed a thing or two because the original post wasn't very detailed and specific. However, I seriously suspect that you are in an unhealthy, and toxic, relationship. I heard someone say that 2 people dating can overcome feelings of anger or even resentment towards each other. Forgiveness can make it seem as though it is brand new start with a bright future ahead. However, the feeling of one's partner, or by one's partner, contempt may be impossible to overcome in a relationship because you can be angry at someone who you respect. I know for a fact, that most, if not all people, feel angry at their parents, teachers, loved ones, sisters, brothers, and romantic partners. However, contempt quite literally means disrespect, and respect is essential for love or even friendship. Contempt is something that can't be remedied in a romantic relationship, because if a person dates someone who they feel contempt for or who they feel annoyed by than *that person* is actually okay with being a toxic person and actually wants to be a toxic person. By making you feel bad about yourself, like you are annoying her, she might feel better about her own self. That is her problem not yours. \n\nDude, it sounds like you need to find a new girlfriend who appreciates your texts because I suspect that this girl may be quite literally draining the life out of you. Other people obviously care for you because they support you.\n\nI know that might seem like a lot of information based on the small paragraph that you wrote, but there will never be a time when one person being annoyed by the other is a good sign in a romantic relationship. It happens quite frequently, it may be more common than you think, but it always results in the one feeling contemptuous, or \"annoyed\", driving the other one, the one who feels affection, into misery. Therefore, I suggest that you act accordingly, and deal with the facts as they are. The facts being that you need to consider things a little more clearly, seeing as how you may need to really take in the fact that everyone who supports you actually cares for you, and there are other things which you may need to recognize and accept for your own emotional health.", "edited": 1483435036.0, "author_flair_css_class": "modmsg", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, something to consider may be the difference between:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I feel like everyone who supports me&lt;/em&gt; is just sick of me and wants nothing to do with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend just seems annoyed&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I am not here to try to convince you to think in one way or the other.

And even though it is okay to have a disagreement with one&amp;#39;s partner every now and then, to feel a little unhappy or displease with them, is a sign that &lt;em&gt;the person feeling annoyed&lt;/em&gt; is doing something wrong. You might really like the girl, I can&amp;#39;t blame you for not ending the relationship. However, annoyance is the opposite of emotional attraction. It is literally the opposite. And it certainly isn&amp;#39;t love. Therefore, it seems to me that she is dating you because some ulterior motives, and I suspect that she may feel good about herself by causing you to feel bad about yourself. Essentially, as she pushes you down so to speak, she may feel as though she is pushing herself up. That is the definition of a toxic person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though there is no shame in loving any girl, I suspect that much of your emotional distress has to do with the girl that you are dating. It seems to me that she has caused you to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; as though you are not good enough for her, as though you are not worthy. That &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; of unworthiness, not actual &amp;quot;unworthiness, just the feeling of it, may have caused you to feel that people who obviously care about you, are &amp;quot;sick&amp;quot; of you, or annoyed, just like the girl who you are dating &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; to be. Those people who support you, are obviously not annoyed by you because they are supporting you. They care for you. They think that you are more than worthy of support, of help, and of care. All the people on this thread also care about you, about supporting you otherwise we would not be writing to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I may have generalized a bit or missed a thing or two because the original post wasn&amp;#39;t very detailed and specific. However, I seriously suspect that you are in an unhealthy, and toxic, relationship. I heard someone say that 2 people dating can overcome feelings of anger or even resentment towards each other. Forgiveness can make it seem as though it is brand new start with a bright future ahead. However, the feeling of one&amp;#39;s partner, or by one&amp;#39;s partner, contempt may be impossible to overcome in a relationship because you can be angry at someone who you respect. I know for a fact, that most, if not all people, feel angry at their parents, teachers, loved ones, sisters, brothers, and romantic partners. However, contempt quite literally means disrespect, and respect is essential for love or even friendship. Contempt is something that can&amp;#39;t be remedied in a romantic relationship, because if a person dates someone who they feel contempt for or who they feel annoyed by than &lt;em&gt;that person&lt;/em&gt; is actually okay with being a toxic person and actually wants to be a toxic person. By making you feel bad about yourself, like you are annoying her, she might feel better about her own self. That is her problem not yours. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dude, it sounds like you need to find a new girlfriend who appreciates your texts because I suspect that this girl may be quite literally draining the life out of you. Other people obviously care for you because they support you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that might seem like a lot of information based on the small paragraph that you wrote, but there will never be a time when one person being annoyed by the other is a good sign in a romantic relationship. It happens quite frequently, it may be more common than you think, but it always results in the one feeling contemptuous, or &amp;quot;annoyed&amp;quot;, driving the other one, the one who feels affection, into misery. Therefore, I suggest that you act accordingly, and deal with the facts as they are. The facts being that you need to consider things a little more clearly, seeing as how you may need to really take in the fact that everyone who supports you actually cares for you, and there are other things which you may need to recognize and accept for your own emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "name": "t1_dbxsjnm", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5lqug5/i_need_to_talk_to_somebody/dbxsjnm/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483462989.0, "author_flair_text": "", "created_utc": 1483434189.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}]
