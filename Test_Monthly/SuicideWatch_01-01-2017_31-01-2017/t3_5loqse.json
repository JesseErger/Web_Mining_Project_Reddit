I don't really know how she will react if i tell her that i feel even worse after 6 months.\n\nI'll probably need to close my social media account, because it's a really big deal to me when i see the chats with her, her profile or her latest posts. Even on Steam, i have her on my friends list and when i accidentally see someone playing a game or getting online and has a similar profile pic, i immediately think that she is alive.\n\nI remember when i was younger how i was afraid going to the cemetery, but now i feel so calm, when i am near her memorial.\n\nFor these 6 months, everything changed in me. My interests, everything. Even my favorite colors or songs. Most of the things i loved to do are forgotten.\n\nI talked with a suicide prevention online, but they only speak about God. Yes, i respect God, but really if i consider suicide, Bible verses won't help me.\n\nI have good friends, but if i tell them all of this, considering the fact 6 months passed it'll be crazy for them.\n\nI've always been a strong person, withstanding many things. It's like a horror movie to me, but without an end. \n\nI lost other loved ones/relatives, but wasn't this bad, compared to now.\n\nUsually, when someone asks me how i am, i answer fine. Somehow i am managing always to put a fake smile and their eyes believe what they see. They think i'm fine. But inside me.. it's not the same. \n\nSometimes i like to walk close to the train rails. Listening to the music, she listened before the tragic moment. I wanted to die instead of her. Of course i didn't tell nobody because everyone will think that i am going to kill myself. But no, i considered this, but every time i go for a walk or sometimes i feel worse or better. Yes, i thought about suicide of the same way she died. Problem is my friends don't feel bad for her death, but i blame even myself. \nIt's like that when she died, my life ended too. \n\nYes, i have these moments where i have some courage and a big will to kill myself the same way. But it somehow ends before i do it.\n\nShe was depressed like for 2 months. But she didn't show it. If i could understand it and help her, she won't be dead now.\n\nMaybe i need time. I need to stop thinking about her, but always i feel how bad is it to be forgotten and if i forgot her, would be really disrespectful.\n\nI have not accepted the fact that she died.

Even on Steam, i have her on my friends list and when i accidentally see someone playing a game or getting online and has a similar profile pic, i immediately think that she is alive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember when i was younger how i was afraid going to the cemetery, but now i feel so calm, when i am near her memorial.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For these 6 months, everything changed in me. My interests, everything. Even my favorite colors or songs. Most of the things i loved to do are forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I talked with a suicide prevention online, but they only speak about God. Yes, i respect God, but really if i consider suicide, Bible verses won&amp;#39;t help me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have good friends, but if i tell them all of this, considering the fact 6 months passed it&amp;#39;ll be crazy for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been a strong person, withstanding many things. It&amp;#39;s like a horror movie to me, but without an end. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lost other loved ones/relatives, but wasn&amp;#39;t this bad, compared to now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually, when someone asks me how i am, i answer fine. Somehow i am managing always to put a fake smile and their eyes believe what they see. They think i&amp;#39;m fine. But inside me.. it&amp;#39;s not the same. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes i like to walk close to the train rails. Listening to the music, she listened before the tragic moment. I wanted to die instead of her. Of course i didn&amp;#39;t tell nobody because everyone will think that i am going to kill myself. But no, i considered this, but every time i go for a walk or sometimes i feel worse or better. Yes, i thought about suicide of the same way she died. Problem is my friends don&amp;#39;t feel bad for her death, but i blame even myself. \nIt&amp;#39;s like that when she died, my life ended too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, i have these moments where i have some courage and a big will to kill myself the same way. But it somehow ends before i do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was depressed like for 2 months. But she didn&amp;#39;t show it. If i could understand it and help her, she won&amp;#39;t be dead now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe i need time. I need to stop thinking about her, but always i feel how bad is it to be forgotten and if i forgot her, would be really disrespectful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have not accepted the fact that she died. Sometimes when i get really sad i text her. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "name": "t1_dbxsskt", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5loqse/is_this_normal_for_my_age/dbxsskt/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483463735.0, "author_flair_text": "", "created_utc": 1483434935.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qpzs", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5loqse", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbxt6fe", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5loqse", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Problems come in all diffrent shapes and sizes dont bash yourself because you think that your problems arnt big.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Problems come in all diffrent shapes and sizes dont bash yourself because you think that your problems arnt big.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "name": "t1_dbxt6fe", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5loqse/is_this_normal_for_my_age/dbxt6fe/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483464905.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1483436105.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}]
