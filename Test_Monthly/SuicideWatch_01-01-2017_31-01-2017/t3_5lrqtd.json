I play video games 12-16 hours a day just as a distraction from reality. Ive never had a job or a girl friend and the only time i have ever kissed a girl was when she was completely drunk. I Fell in love with a girl and she told me the same, she started talking to other guys and denying it, eventually it all came out and she had a thing going on with another guy. She told me she still liked me but things were just complicated, i basically never have gotten over her since because im in a fat friend zone but i still like her, she is literally the only reason i had to live. Ive explained how i feel in great detail multiple times and she seems to care to some degree about the way i feel. She asks to come over all the time and i fucking hate her coming over because i love it. It is literally the definition of happiness for me when we talk for hours about nothing at all, or just her sitting at my computer chair playing the walking dead or listening to the same music we both like, or just watching you tube or Netflix together on the couch. So pretty much to summarise me for the last couple months this has been my thought process &amp;quot;I have never been told im loved in 18 years of being alive in this shitty fucking world, I have been told a few months ago that i was loved, even though she has priority&amp;#39;s over me (other guys) i will still be there for her and suffer so when finally she gets over the other people ill be her last option&amp;quot; which yes, i fucking know, its not healthy AT ALL. Dont think i dont fucking know that, i want to fucking die because ive come to the point in my life where i literally have to suffer for weeks on end just to see her again, be SO FUCKING HAPPY for a few hours, watch her go home and see her talking to other guys on social media, tagging this other guy in all this cute relationship bullshit. I how i wish it was me, i would give everything i have to be that happy, all you cunts take this shit for granted. Anyway, she came over again today, we played tomb raider, walking dead listened to music, watched YouTube blah blah just fun shit, anyway she logged into her steam to play Amnesia, therefore having to log into her email to get the password. We had a good time etc etc, she leaves, i go back and check her emails because, well ya know, im a jealous little cunt with a lot of curiosity (It was facebook notifications via email) basically dating back to when she was telling me she liked me she was also chatting to at least another 4-5 guys and messaging hearts and the guys would be saying shit like &amp;quot;You too, I love you so much&amp;quot; etc etc i see that shit and realise, i have never been loved in my entire life, no one has ever loved me as much as i have loved them, everything i have ever been told is a lie and i want to fucking die. I&amp;#39;ve come to the decision i am going to kill myself via suspension hanging at about 2 or 3 am this morning, it is currently 11:00 pm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, i know alot of other people have it worse, blah blah, africans, blah blah, idgaf i put myself out to people and all i get is lies that temporarily make me feel good but just make it so much worse later.
