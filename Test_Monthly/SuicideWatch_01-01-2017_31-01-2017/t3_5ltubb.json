The real point when this all kicked off though, is i still remeber when i was 12, the soul shattering and subsequent mental breakdown of realising that my parents were going to die one day and there wasn&amp;#39;t anything i could do about it, i remember my thoughts and behaviour took on a grey depressive shade from that point on, too much of a mental burden for a 12 year old to take imo but &lt;em&gt;shrug&lt;/em&gt; life went on and i just let it fester, even till this day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From about my mid-teens i remember always being compared to my more succesfull cousins, my parents thought it would help inspire? us but to me it had the opposite effect, it was like &amp;quot;Hey! I&amp;#39;m me, wtf are you comparing your younger kids to our cousins who are at least 5 years older? So infatuated with the idea of becoming an successful accountant, my mother pushed me to study it at degree level even though it was hands-down one of my worst subjects in college and i HATED it. Dropped out as you would expect half way through my first year when i realised i had nothing in common with the people there and i had no desire for that occupation at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that i floundered for a year, learning some lessons along the way and making mistakes but never learning from them. Went back to college, studied IT then followed that up with 3 years in university, graduated but guess what? you actually need to be social and semi-outgoing in order to get a job, who&amp;#39;d have thought? I&amp;#39;m actually going to go against popular consensus here and say it isn&amp;#39;t just who you know but also what you know and how you apply it in order to succeed but more than all of that? Self-belief, if you don&amp;#39;t believe in yourself, clich\u00e9 as it sounds, you got no chance because if you don&amp;#39;t believe in yourself, who will? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just seems the more longer i live, the more regrets rack up and because of my stupid mentality, my brain hardly remembers all my achievements and the few good stuff that happened in my life, only the bad and how everything is painted with a grey/black brush. I want to believe that i can still lift myself out of this, i do not WANT to be like this i just don&amp;#39;t know any other way and when you been brought up to believe what society has told you, go to college, go to university, get a degree, get a job, get a spouse, start a family, own a home, and you find yourself way off that track, wtf do you do? I read stories over and over of people who don&amp;#39;t fit that mold, who went against that grain and still managed to carve out a life for themselves, but i haven&amp;#39;t got a clue how they do it or where that self-belief comes from. Essentially i feel like a failure at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think at the end of the day, what it comes down to is that as human beings, we have survived against the odds and made all these fantastic advancements because we learned to co-operate and get along with each other, and honestly i feel the push towards technology and media&amp;#39;s focus on the individual rather than the whole is putting more people at risk of feeling isolated and alone for whatever reason. Personally i don&amp;#39;t like the direction the world is going in but maybe that&amp;#39;s because my own situation is not that great and is colouring my perception of outside events that are largely neutral, there&amp;#39;s always two sides to every situation which people cope/rationalise whatever way they believe or was brought up with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Idk really where i wanted to go with this, maybe i just want someone to tell me it&amp;#39;ll be alrite, you&amp;#39;re still &amp;#39;young&amp;#39; whatever the heck that is supposed to mean, you can still turn yourself around.
