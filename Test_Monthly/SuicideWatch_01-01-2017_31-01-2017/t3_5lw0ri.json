I started going when I was 7 after my birth father died suddenly and unexpectedly when I was 5. Then I felt better by the time I was about 9. When I was 12 I started to get bullied relentlessly for medical condition that I had no control over. I didn&amp;#39;t tell my parents afraid they wouldn&amp;#39;t understand and take away my computer. I got better after I left middle school only for it to come right back shortly when I entered into high school. Then senior year of high school all of my friends, all at once stopped talking to me and began to completely ignore me. Thats when I reached out to my parents who my mother was horrifed that I wanted to commit suicide, she felt awful that all these years she never knew her child was in so much pain. So my parents were the only reason I graduated from high school since I literally had no motivation to go to school any longer and just wanted to go to college as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now people always told me &amp;quot;it gets better once you&amp;#39;re done with high school&amp;quot;. Well I guess that&amp;#39;s wrong for me, only after 3 weeks of college I had to drop out because of the mental trauma that had happened when I was in high school. It felt as if nothing had changed and that college was just like high school. I had a mental meltdown. I stopped going to class after about 1 1/2 weeks i then locked myself into my dorm and never left. I gained over 20 pounds in less than 2 weeks since to cope I began to eat. When I came home that weekend I begged my mother to let me leave that if I had stayed there any longer I would commit suicide. I&amp;#39;ve been home ever since then.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SO now I&amp;#39;m in my 20`s and I still don&amp;#39;t have a job because I&amp;#39;m afraid people will judge me or I&amp;#39;ll become even more miserable than I already am and I absolutely terrified about going back to college and it&amp;#39;ll be just as awful as it was back then or if I go to local community college that I&amp;#39;ll see the people who hate me or bullied me. I&amp;#39;m very luck to have such supportive parents who have tried everything to help me. But nothing seems to work...\nTL;DR: my life has been pretty shitty&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing that keeps me from ending it is my mother who says if I died she might as well throw herself in the coffin with me (I&amp;#39;m an only child so it&amp;#39;s not like she would have another child to lean on) and a friend who I&amp;#39;m completely in love with (which if you knew me well you&amp;#39;d know I&amp;#39;ve been in and out of relationships since I was 15 and I have literally no emotions of love in me what so ever; I see very little in relationships) Also that I&amp;#39;m terrified to take my own life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just recently got out of my last therapy cycle about a little after December and I was feeling great! I thought the medicine was working again and I was gunna put in my college applications and start living again! Well today I&amp;#39;ve just gone back to where I started. I didn&amp;#39;t even get on my computer today I just laid in bed and did nothing... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worst of all recently I&amp;#39;ve fallen in love with someone that made me feel amazing and I want to be with them and all that jazz! But.. it&amp;#39;s becoming clear to me now they&amp;#39;ll never feel the same and I&amp;#39;ve done my hardest to keep being optimistic! Cause I haven&amp;#39;t felt like this since I was 15 and it&amp;#39;s great. But I&amp;#39;m not special to them... I&amp;#39;m just like they&amp;#39;re other friends. They know how I feel about them but they&amp;#39;re not ready for a relationship yet and said they don&amp;#39;t feel that way towards me but &amp;quot;Maybe someday! I can&amp;#39;t predict the future&amp;quot; this phrase alone was the sole reason I wanted to keep going in life! Cause maybe one day I can make them happy too!

I&amp;#39;m questioning on whether I should disconnect myself to save me from the heartache I&amp;#39;m afraid of. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s awful and toxic to think like this and I know its wrong but I just don&amp;#39;t know what to do.
