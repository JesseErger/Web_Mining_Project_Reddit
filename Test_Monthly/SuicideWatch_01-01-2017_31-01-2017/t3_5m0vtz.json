Over the past 6-7 months have been an absolute nightmare for me on a mental level. I have set a standard for myself that was instilled in me by my Dad who subsequently passed on in 1995, which I went through the grieving process and made it through. I was pushed to do well in everything I do, for example, in school if I got a B+ or lower, I was disciplined. I understand why it was done so I have a better chance of succeeding and not give up on what I do. Anyway, on to now. I had been dating this girl for around eight months and she was begging me for a baby, and shazam, we made one!! And then..all of a sudden things started going sour. I do admit I have an anger issue because I hold myself to a certain standard. I bowl three nights a week and I got really upset and frustrated, and I&amp;#39;d blame her some when I made bad shots because of what we were talking about or whatever, however, I&amp;#39;ve told her before that no matter what I say or if I blame you, you and I both know who threw the ball, so, in the end I know it&amp;#39;s my fault on a bad shot. She would bitch about how I didn&amp;#39;t want to do anything or I was tired or how I didn&amp;#39;t exactly clean a litter box every day or do the dishes every day. Now I guess she has a point, at the time I was an Assistant Manager in a fast food establishment working 65+ hours a week covering my boss&amp;#39; ass and pretty much doing their job because they weren&amp;#39;t going to do it, so I guess she had a point of me being lazy. She lived with me until the end of October-ish and then she left to go live with another friend. Mind you, she stayed at my place and watched television all day, I bought food, she never had to pay anything. Anyway, her parents never liked me for some reason, even to the point where he Mom came into my restaurant and cussed me out. So her registration expired and got pulled over, so her Mom went to get her at her friend&amp;#39;s and put her lockdown. At this point now, I&amp;#39;ve now become a piece of shit who can&amp;#39;t take care of himself and can&amp;#39;t afford anything so there&amp;#39;s no way I could afford a baby. Like I have a cat, I ran out of food one night and had a can downstairs waiting for my direct deposit to clear. In November, I was blocked on all social media with no explination and my friend&amp;#39;s saw on her account that &amp;quot;she had a new boyfriend,&amp;quot; and when I said something about it, she said it was her cousin and then gave me an ultimatum on telling her who said that to me. She also said her phone is going to be disconnected in December, even though she has the money to keep it on..she even said I have an ultimatum of either I sign all rights to her or her Mom said she has lawyers and money set aside to mess my life up even more. I don&amp;#39;t understand why I&amp;#39;m such a terrible person, this led to a lot of self-harm and self-mutilation because of the mental anguish and pain I&amp;#39;ve been put through. On top of this, I changed careers, I got to a point where I couldn&amp;#39;t accept doing two people&amp;#39;s jobs for over two years straight, so I completed a bartending course and started a bartending career, in which I&amp;#39;m having trouble with because of gender discrimination, I can&amp;#39;t get a job because I don&amp;#39;t have boobs with a lowcut shirt, I mean you can have that and a shitty drink, or a conversation and a drink crafted by someone who wants to make a name for themself in a field that is fun..it sucks I&amp;#39;m also broke trying to make it and do my absolute best to be positive, but as soon as one thing goes wrong, I&amp;#39;m absolutely done with whatever I&amp;#39;m doing..if it can&amp;#39;t go right then why bother..I have a lot of frustration and anger seeded in all of this..I don&amp;#39;t really see a reason for me to do life anymore when it&amp;#39;s been frutrating and I can&amp;#39;t catch a break..I&amp;#39;ve tried before, I did enough Vicodin to kill a horse and I survived because there is an entity that enjoys torturing me..I guess I&amp;#39;ll have to up the dose to elephant here soon..&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Let this start off by me saying, I know I've made mistakes in my life and I've moved on from them.
