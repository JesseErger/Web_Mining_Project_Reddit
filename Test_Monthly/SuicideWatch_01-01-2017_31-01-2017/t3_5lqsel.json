And not enough courage to create and carve out a weird life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don&amp;#39;t know why I became like this. I was normal up until about 6-7 years ago. Half way through uni the depression just hit me hard from some weird circumstances. Now, I&amp;#39;m fucking stuck in a nightmare. Things got worse and worse. Cringeworthy bad. And even though I can think it could always be worse, I dont see things getting any better. When the want leaves, that sucks. Not having, enduring pain for a later reward sure, but when you just dont care anymore, and thats how i&amp;#39;ve felt for years, you gotta just wonder how bad of an option suicide really is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Life is suffering. But only the strong shall survive. I&amp;#39;m done suffering and I don&amp;#39;t have the strength to continue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of this, I&amp;#39;m like &amp;quot;scared of girls&amp;quot;. Never was, but again I don&amp;#39;t know why, past few years, the deterioration of my mental faculties has been alarming to say the least. I could if I wanted to but I just dont care, and dont want to put that burden on someone else. A man should have a woman. Not a selfish weak spineless creature like myself. And no I&amp;#39;m not into any weird shit. Just a ton of self loathing. Being the youngest of many siblings will do that. They constantly beat the shit out of you and a controlling father to the point of exhaustion. But I&amp;#39;m not sure I can even blame them anymore. I cant blame society either. I can only blame myself, and I try to blame genetics but thats not true either. It&amp;#39;s me. And I know it has to come from within, but the tank ran out a couple years ago and I&amp;#39;ve been stalling ever since. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think this is my destiny.

It was an embarrassment, it was shameful and a public  disaster that should never be inflicted on anyone. so what now, I tried, but it aint getting better. this is what it fucking is. call it what it is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This species is supposed to be survival of the fittest. And I am by far not the fittest. I&amp;#39;m a mutation of a psychopath (not trying to be edgy here, its just a good summary of the negative traits) or something or just weak. I&amp;#39;ve tried accepting myself, but I am not something that ought to be accepted, it would be a denial of truth to accept something that is unacceptable. You wouldent take a gift wrapped turd and smile and thank the person who gave it to you and thats what I am pretty much. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So on that note, I may give the suicide hotline a call, but I don&amp;#39;t know guys, I don&amp;#39;t know what did us in.
