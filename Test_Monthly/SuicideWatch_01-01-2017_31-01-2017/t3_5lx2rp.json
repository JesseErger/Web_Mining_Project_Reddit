I also asked her to please talk to her therapist about being at this point, see if she can offer somethibg that could help, drugs, support groups, anything, anything that helps her stop this pain but allows us that love her so much to still have her in our lives. She agreed to talk to the therapist and said she wouldn&amp;#39;t do anything tonight, also agreed to Skype as I told her I deserve one last face to face goodbye before she does something like this.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m at, I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.

For example, when someone who has an ongoing traumatic fear of rejection gets a message that they perceive as curt, that's going to give them a flashback experience where the tiny thing creates a huge firestorm inside their head.  This is *not* easy for a partner to live with, but as you've learned the hard way, telling them that the topic is stupid is *not* going to help.  Do try to remember that everything we experience is inside our heads - we don't have access to outer reality, only to what our brains tell us about outer reality.

For example, when someone who has an ongoing traumatic fear of rejection gets a message that they perceive as curt, that&amp;#39;s going to give them a flashback experience where the tiny thing creates a huge firestorm inside their head.  This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; easy for a partner to live with, but as you&amp;#39;ve learned the hard way, telling them that the topic is stupid is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to help.  Do try to remember that everything we experience is inside our heads - we don&amp;#39;t have access to outer reality, only to what our brains tell us about outer reality.
