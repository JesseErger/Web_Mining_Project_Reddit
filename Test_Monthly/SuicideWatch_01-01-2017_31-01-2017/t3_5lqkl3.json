Anyways she&amp;#39;s in her early twenty&amp;#39;s, works part time 30ish hours a week and has been going to college.  Tonight she came to me crying.  She was telling me how she needs to take off from college and find a full time job so that she can get help.  Before the divorce was finalized she was able to see a dr. using their insurance and was able to get a sample of some medication and a prescription.  She said the medicine worked and helped measurably but was too expensive to buy now that her insurance is gone.  So tonight she also revealed to me that she&amp;#39;s been feeling suicidal.  Since she hasn&amp;#39;t told anyone else this and doesn&amp;#39;t want to I need to help her out.  Do you guys know of any free medical assistance resources for suicidal person with little income?
