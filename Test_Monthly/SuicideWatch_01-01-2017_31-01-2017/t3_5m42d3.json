My father would often yell at me, forcefully immobilize me for a long time and sometimes beat me. \nMy mother was emotionally numb and disconnected and they both were alcoholics. \nI know it's not of much use to cast blame and such, since they themselves did not have great parents either, except for my grandma. \n\nSo, anyways. They are gone now and I am left with PTSD from all the neglect, abuse and emotional horror between my parents and never really developed a sense of self-worth, or feeling that I could trust anyone ever really. \nThen I developed this almost constant feeling of stress and anxiety during elementary school. I felt like vomiting every time I was in the bathroom in the morning before school. Eventually in 8th grade I missed so many school days - I either went straight to the GP instead of school or I took a walk in the forests and fields. My parents didn't know at first and even the doctor said it's just a phase or a mild depression at worst. Sure It's no problem when you're all shaky, you have sweaty hands, you feel like vomiting and you can't fall asleep anymore until you've been up for 2 days straight. With all that anxiety I could not enjoy life like the others - I was different. Something was wrong with me. I could not make new friends. I had bad grades and I plunged into a deep depression when I realized that due to my anxiety, low self-esteem and self-doubt I would not be able to achieve anything I wanted in life. Go to university, move to Canada, get the creative job I wanted and get the girl I loved and kind of still love in a way. We were close and intimate and had a very unique relationship. Those six months with her were probably the happiest days of my life. \n\nDuring junior high I had to repeat an entire year because I missed so many days of school and then during senior high I just had to quit school, because I could not go on anymore with all the anxiety and depression. I wanted to kill myself, just stay in my bed and die of starvation. \nI found out that unfortunately you don't really die if you don't eat for 3 weeks. You just start to drink sugar water when your stomach ejects and rejects solid food. \n\nMy parents did not care much of course. They had their own problems and we severed any connection. I would look the other way if they saw me in the hallway and we ignored each other. I was basically only using their tap water and soda and every few days steal food from the fridge. \n\nSome friends and some other people I knew were worried sometimes but what could they do? My father finally took off when I was 16 and then I only had to deal with a mentally deranged mother and her convoluted ways of trying to shame me into leaving the apartment or ending my life.\n \nThere were times when I did not even see the light of day for a whole week because I was so ashamed of myself I did not want my neighbors to see me. \n\nI did grow and learn a lot as I got older. Using the Internet I learned to code, edit video, make electronic music and sound effects, play the guitar and keyboard. I learned about graphics design and how to create animated movies and use 3D graphic engines to create video games. I can now read and understand seven different languages, but the condition of anxiety and depression did not change much during the years after I left school and doctors and psychotherapists were not able to help me much either. If it were not for the internet I would probably be dead already. \n\nI wanted to be happy and heal, but how? After I started to read a lot of self-help books I did all the usual stuff people with cancer and mental problems do like walking in nature, jogging, exercise, eating a vegan and unprocessed diet (I basically already only drank water anyways because I had no money), meditation and relaxation techniques etc. but it did not help.  \n\nAt this point I had pretty much lost all my friends. They gave up on me .. understandably .. In a way I gave up on them too by being sick. \n\nSome years later I had severe insomnia and still the same anxieties, PTSD, guilt, shame, low self esteem and I wanted to kill myself. \nEventually I found a social worker and I told her that I was homeless and a few weeks later she convinced me to go to a kind of shelter / psychiatric establishment where I was abused by the night staff doctor and then when I tried to leave the next day they forced me back into the room I was sleeping and locked me in. Since then my anxiety got so extreme that I will probably never recover from that experience. \n\nI was then shipped of into another institution where they said:' either you work here or you're going back on the streets. ' \nI wasn't forced to work for long hours but my anxiety and depression got so bad that I thought about killing myself every single day. \n\nEventually I saw an ad for a room online that I could rent for six months pretending to be a college student. I had collected some social welfare money and was able to pay most of the money upfront. I pretended to study software development and luckily my roommates were pretty clueless and simpleminded. So then I was living the life of an imposture and I managed to get a bank account and a credit card. \n\nAt the end of the six month term I paid a real-estate agent a huge bribe with my credit card for preferred treatment for a rental object. \n\nI rented that apartment for three years, until I was 26, during which I tried to do all sorts of things to overcome my emotional problems and achieve the goals in my life. \nI think I went to three different psychotherapists and tried to get my high school degree twice. I had some different jobs for a few days until they fired me or I called in sick because of a mental breakdown. \nIn the end my anxiety was so severe that I could not fall asleep at night and I felt like shit all day. My depression was so bad that I could not get out of bed in the morning even when I had scheduled appointments. I thought about dying almost every day.  What a miserable shit I am. \n\nThen last spring I spontaneously bought a around the world plane ticket with my credit card visiting several countries backpacking without any money or accommodation. The trip took 14 days and I was ready to do it because I was ready to die. I had nothing to lose, so I spent the money I did not have and I have never felt that sense of wonder and belonging as directly as then in all my life. The anxiety almost killed me and I had several mental breakdowns and a lot of panic attacks on the flight, crying on the subway, and in all kinds of social situations. Luckily nobody called the authorities or anything. \n\nAfter I returned I realized that the life I was living here in my home country was not worth the suffering I had to endure so I decided to move somewhere else or die trying. I moved out of the apartment and sold all of the furniture. I went to a different city far away and tried to find a new place to stay to the best of my abilities considering my anxiety and depression. \n\nI tried for three months with no results. I felt like a total failure and my depression got worse. I cried a lot and running low on money I decided I wanted to see the sea one more time before I killed myself. \n\nShortly before the train took off I decided to go to the airport instead and I used my credit card to book a flight to Tokyo figuring I could just as well watch the sea there. \n\nIn Tokyo I managed to book a very cheap AirBnB. My constant anxiety never got any better during that time but my depression got slightly better and my PTSD disappeared. I felt that if I could maintain the emotional energy I had here in Tokyo I could maybe find a way to continue my life. \n\nAbout two weeks into my stay I got an email from a distant relative and I replied to her that I wanted to start my life over and asked if I could stay in her spare room until I found my own apartment. She said yes so I decided to go back to my home country. Several days before my return flight I felt the anxiety and depression returning and I began to realize what an enormous mistake I had made thinking my emotional state would be any different than before I came to Tokyo. I did not manage to hold on to any of the positive emotions I had during my stay there. \n\nI can not construct any rational plan or, way of life that will lead to the cessation of my depression or my anxiety nor can I think of any person that can help me. i think I tried pretty much anything in terms of \"finding help\" I could have tried. I can't think of any achievable thing that would make my life worth living. \n\nIt has been about one month since I returned from Japan. I managed to look up a few rentals but overall my anxiety, ptsd and depression is as worse as it ever was and I don't want to live anymore. They re going to throw me out of the room I live in 10 days because her landlord found out and wants me gone. \nI'm going to be homeless again. I'm fucked. I think I'm going to freeze to death in this cold or maybe kill myself if it gets too painful. I have no more money and my bank account along with my cards are going to be closed next month and I'm probably going to have to pay back a lot of money. \n\nI feel like I have lived a long painful life. But now that I have seen the world and experienced so many different things, learned so many things about nature, people and myself I feel like I am ready to die one last time.
