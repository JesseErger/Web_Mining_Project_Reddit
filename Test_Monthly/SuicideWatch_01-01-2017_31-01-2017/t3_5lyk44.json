Or you have haunting memories and bad experiences instead who pull you down.\n\nEdit 2: \n\nAnd there are plenty of things I _can't_ change anything about.

Stick the list in your pocket. And when you find yourself thinking one of these thoughts, reach in your pocket and squeeze that list as hard as you can. Then say to yourself, \"The thought isn't the problem. Squeezing my mind around the thought is the problem.\" Then relax your fist. Relax your mind. And look around. There's a lot more out there than what these thoughts are telling you.\n\n\n\nOr you might tear each thought into their own little strips and put them in a bag. Think of the bag as garbage. To be free of pain, you only have to follow one rule. You can think about any subject in the garbage bag whenever you want, but to do so, you must take the strip with that subject on it out of the garbage, and you must hold it in your hands while you think about it. When you feel you are finished, drop the strip back in the garbage. When you feel down, whether at that moment or later, pick out a strip from the bag and read it. When you have read it and thought it, put it down once you start to think something else. Then pick up another strip and do the same thing. Keep doing this until you have gone through all of them.\n\n\nYou are really the only authority on what can hurt you, when you choose to refuse to let go of your garbage, you get what I'm saying?\n\n\n\nAnd that's only going to keep you from wasting any more of the opportunity you have left to think, feel, and live a different way. But you are still here and every new moment is a new moment to begin again. All we ever have is each new moment, so the opportunity is renewed infinitely, or at least until our time is up here on earth.\n\n\n\nBut while you are still here, keep getting back up, out of the garbage of those thoughts that keeping you feeling unable to live in the only moment there is--the now--and keep beginning  anew.\n\n\n\nAs the saying goes, you'll never be more young and healthy than you are now. That will be true of every moment you live here on out.\n\n\nSo how about trying to be more kind to yourself going forward, to stop swimming in the garbage of thoughts that have long gone moldy whenever you find yourself in it and come up to the air of the clean, new moment that you have before you always?\n\n\n\nYou are valuable--**priceless**--no matter what. So please do stop being unkind to yourself in those ways. All just might be ok in the end; if it's not ok now, it's not yet the end.\n\n\n\nPlease take care, and may peace be with you.\n\n\nThank you and God bless you. Feel free to keep me updated. I care!\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nDerrick\n\n\n_________________\n\nP.S. I have to credit the exercises in paragraph  5 and 6 to Hugh Prather, *The Little Book of Letting Go*. Conari Press, 2000.

I wish you comfort and relief. At least some of it also sounds to me like you are being hard on yourself. You live with a condition that puts obstacles in your way and maybe you give yourself more discredit for what might be more attributable to the obstacles you struggle with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But whatever guilt or regret you are feeling, you don&amp;#39;t need to hold on so tight to whatever it is that goes through your mind that produces those or any other unhelpful emotions that keep you from moving forward or from feeling something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if the guilt and regret are warranted, holding on tight to the thoughts behind these emotions might just keep you from being able to do what you can to remedy the situation, or letting them overtake you to the point where you aren&amp;#39;t living life and seeing and hearing more of what the truth out there is trying to tell you, which you might not be able to fully take in when you are gripping tight to an outlook that keeps you in the dark and immobilized mentally and emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So maybe you have to let go of those thoughts that you squeeze onto and that keep producing these feelings.
