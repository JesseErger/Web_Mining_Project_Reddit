People would think it was being done out of self pity, or a cry for help, or something similar. Instead, I was just tired of playing games, and of hurting people. I felt like I was procrastinating, always telling my boyfriends that I wanted to kill myself. Told them over and over again, but never actually did anything. Then, I was given a choice by one of them, and I couldn&amp;#39;t handle the choices. Decided that I&amp;#39;d hurt them less by just choosing nothing, killing myself, than by making a choice that would affect them. Didn&amp;#39;t realize that they would think that I was using possible suicide as a self pity move, because I never saw it that way. I did, however, see it as a game that I needed to stop playing with myself. Either do it, or stop talking about it. So I tried it. Got help. It kinda works. But then I had to make the choice, the one I didn&amp;#39;t want to make originally. I chose one boyfriend over the others. But he wouldn&amp;#39;t commit until I had more help. And honestly, he wasn&amp;#39;t the one that I really loved. So I hurt him, and went with the one I truly loved. I didn&amp;#39;t realize how badly I hurt him though, until I asked to talk to him and explain my reasoning. He refused to even think about talking to me. He won&amp;#39;t talk to anyone, he just stays by my gf&amp;#39;s side, waiting for her to wake up. It&amp;#39;s his &amp;quot;job&amp;quot;, he said, to stay by her, not to talk to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;d been thinking for a while.

Hell, I knew how to succeed last time. I just had others to think about. But it&amp;#39;s likely that I will either be in a successful relationship, or that I won&amp;#39;t be. If I&amp;#39;m not, then there won&amp;#39;t be someone to think about other than myself. I&amp;#39;ve been lonely and depressed for too long, I won&amp;#39;t continue for years again. I&amp;#39;ll just make sure that nobody I care about thinks that I did anything because of them. It won&amp;#39;t be because of anyone else, it will just be because of me. Because I can&amp;#39;t be the person that can manage without being loved and needed. Right now, I&amp;#39;m loved, needed, even if I&amp;#39;m still lonely and depressed (long distance relationships suck).
