I was friends with A until senior year when he started going crazy. I cared about the dude because he was a good friend to me and I&amp;#39;d at least try to help when he was feeling down. Anyways, nearing the end of the year, A tells me that he&amp;#39;s fallen head over heels for a girl (we will call her B). B is a good friend of mine that I&amp;#39;ve known ever since freshman year and she&amp;#39;s a kindhearted individual. So, B rejects A&amp;#39;s advances and politely turns him down. Later on, A began to be desperate and started doing some illogical things. He&amp;#39;d wait for hours for her to show up somewhere knowing she wouldn&amp;#39;t be there, he&amp;#39;d try messaging her at 2-3 in the morning telling her he&amp;#39;d wait a million years for her and that he&amp;#39;s sorry for any uncomfortable positions he put her in, or he&amp;#39;d even begin cutting for her to show his loyalty. One day, he invited me over to his house to hang out and I noticed something strange when I entered. He had multiple pictures/drawings of her and whenever i tried to change the subject to something lighthearted, he&amp;#39;d always find a way to revert back to the &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sad and I love her. I want to kms&amp;quot; deal. Of course, I tried to tell him that killing yourself isn&amp;#39;t the way to go and it&amp;#39;d leave his family and those who cared for him to be sad, but to no avail. I asked my other friends to help and they tried saying they care for him too, but honestly, I believe he only wanted &amp;quot;her&amp;quot; input and comfort. Weeks later, he messages me a picture of a well known spot for couples and a pic of a noose saying &amp;quot;I think this&amp;#39;ll work&amp;quot;. I got out of my way to stay with him for a week so he wouldn&amp;#39;t do anything stupid. We talked every night until 3am about life. Literally almost every advance of helping his suicidal behavior from me and others were brushed off when he asked to be helped in the first place. Asking for help and telling everyone to F off because nothing will help because I am depressed blah blah blah is pretty childish and hypocritical Imo. I honestly just feel as if all this &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; for him is just being blocked out and that he&amp;#39;s just guilt tripping everyone to feel bad for him. More importantly, I feel that his depression and his self-demeaning comments like &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a loser&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;no one will love me&amp;quot;, etc. just puts a larger burden on others that it becomes irrelevant in their lives. 1 month later, A went on to off himself without letting anybody knowing (no suicide note,no messages). He offed himself on B&amp;#39;s birthday which I guess was to spite her. Honestly, I feel like there&amp;#39;s nothing better we could&amp;#39;ve done to help the poor guy leading up to such a tragic moment. I&amp;#39;ve tried time and time again to cheer him up and comfort him. I&amp;#39;ve come to the realization that all those sad moments he left me with are just weighing me down and I can&amp;#39;t let that get to me. It was out of his own free will to do what he did and my condolences go to the family. That wasn&amp;#39;t my friend in those sad moments I spent with him. It was as if he was a completely different person.
