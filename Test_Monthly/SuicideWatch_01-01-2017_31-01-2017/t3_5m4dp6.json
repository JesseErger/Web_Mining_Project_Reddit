I don&amp;#39;t know what to do and I need to get this off my chest. TLDR at end&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m getting extremely close to killing myself. Making it all official. This has happened once before and I&amp;#39;ve been hospitalized. After that, things just got worse until I entered a DBT skills group. During that time I felt like my life long struggles with mental illness were navigational. The program really showed me how I was destroying my own life and opened my eyes to the decades of emotional abuse I&amp;#39;ve been through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I graduated from that program around a year ago and reality hit me in the face hard. I was literally trying to scrape together what I could, starting from the bottom of whatever pyramid or ocean life is. Here I sit, still sifting through the ruin of my life and still very much at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t feel like a real person. I feel gutted and useless. A hallow shell. Life is pointless. It really is. I&amp;#39;m a waste of space that can do nothing but exist in the hell space of my own mind and crumble beneath the weight of living. I use up resources and have no real connections with any person or living thing. The thing is, I have tons of friends, just none I feel a true connection with. Like chemistry doesn&amp;#39;t exist or I don&amp;#39;t really click with anyone. It&amp;#39;s disconcerting. Oftentimes I feel like an alien looking down from their spacecraft.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not that I don&amp;#39;t care. My emotions are intense and I hate to see any other living thing suffering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to glean value from extrinsic actions still does nothing for me to increase my own sense of worth. For example, I volunteer at an animal shelter almost daily and join protests for causes I believe in, but I don&amp;#39;t feel any different, even though I&amp;#39;ve read these things are supposed to help. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I don&amp;#39;t understand is how I can spend so much time in therapy, doing programs, taking medication, trying more natural methods, etc, etc... and still feel like I need to die and want to die constantly.  It&amp;#39;s been so many years and I&amp;#39;m so afraid. It&amp;#39;s like this can&amp;#39;t be fixed. Obviously I&amp;#39;ve been putting in effort to change my thinking and self perception, but it has been years. I don&amp;#39;t believe in the &amp;quot;It gets better.&amp;quot; It has only gotten worse. The future is looking bleak. I have no reliable family, nothing really going for me and incredible debt in medical and student loans. Financially, I won&amp;#39;t last much longer. Trying to get a leg up and get an education proved to be an ineffective solution to my low income status. Every day my inner voice tells me I should just die and I&amp;#39;d be better off dead. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think about jumping or driving off the bridge, I think about crashing my car. What&amp;#39;s stopping me? Even though I&amp;#39;m estranged from my family their faces still pop up when these thoughts creep in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It makes me so angry. How do these people that call themselves my family, that don&amp;#39;t even love me for me, have any right to be sad if I were to perish? They love me under false pretenses. Simply because I am a relative, not because I&amp;#39;m me. I hear how hatefully they talk about &amp;quot;other people&amp;quot; and I fall into those categories too often to brush it off. They are dysfunctional and often toxic, their love misguided. (At this point, I should also mention that my father is the abuser just to hit home the point that my family life isn&amp;#39;t peachy).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Death is always on my mind. I&amp;#39;m afraid one of these times I&amp;#39;ll actually do it. Like right now, it would be so easy. I&amp;#39;m not afraid of death, I welcome it. What I&amp;#39;m afraid of is what it&amp;#39;ll take to get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: my life is pointless, decade of therapy experience, no cure, no future, daily suicidal ideation and fantasizing, peace out cruel world \u270c\ufe0f&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello, this is my first post on Reddit.
