I&amp;#39;m completely okay with that now. That makes me a fucking awful person, I know - but I&amp;#39;m &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; an awful person! So it makes no difference in the grand scheme of things. A bit awful or a lot awful, I&amp;#39;m still awful.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of you may wonder, what makes me awful? Well, I&amp;#39;m self-absorbed. I don&amp;#39;t care about anyone elses problems but my own. When other people complain about the issues in their life (like a co-worker fibromyalgia, a friend with a heart defect who is constantly at risk of clots and heart attacks, or an online buddy suffering from alcoholism), I have no idea what to say but &amp;quot;that sucks&amp;quot; anymore because I truly can&amp;#39;t sympathize with their pain - that&amp;#39;s how wrapped up I am in my own idiotic ideas of loneliness and hopelessness. Not only that, but I&amp;#39;m an asshole to anyone and everyone who tries to help. Even if they &lt;em&gt;aren&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; trying to help, just trying to get me to help them with something simple or to do something later (a task at work or a chore at home, etc.), I snap at them. It&amp;#39;s got me in trouble more times than I can count, and I just can&amp;#39;t control it any longer.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, I honestly think that the world would be better without me. Even though those half-dozen people&amp;#39;s lives would be worse-off, because of the grief they feel, that would be temporary. But the grief that I give them while alive, the pain and annoyance that I make them suffer through on a daily basis, exists as long as I do. So, in battle between the temporary grief of my death and the semi-permanent anger my life brings, I believe death wins.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course, there&amp;#39;s always the fact that once I&amp;#39;m dead, I won&amp;#39;t be around to care.
