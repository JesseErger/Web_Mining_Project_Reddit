You may have to give up access to all media except at work or a basic non-smart phone, or greater sacrifices, but it will be worth it. \n\nOther things to help may be switching to drawn porn, to reduce the impact on actual children, although this will require significant effort, as you are aware, as the dopamine hit will be much less. \n\nWhile cutting contact with the forums and sources that you are on is the main priority, and is essential, you can also help while you do so and relapse by contacting your governments CP police investigation anonymously and report everything you find once you visit.
