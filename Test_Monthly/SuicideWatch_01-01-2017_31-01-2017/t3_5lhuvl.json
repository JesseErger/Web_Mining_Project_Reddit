My living room! Which is also my kitchen and dining room - kinda all one space on the first floor. But it&amp;#39;s relatively recently that I&amp;#39;ve had a laptop and don&amp;#39;t have to sit at a desk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, she&amp;#39;s great, and better than I deserve, that&amp;#39;s for sure. We used to work at the same place -- she&amp;#39;s still there, but I quit back in 2015, and changed jobs to a new job that turned out to be 18 months of a nightmare that culminated (for a few reasons, my fault) in a second attempt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been depressed since childhood. Around eight or nine I think is when I first started talking about suicide. I DO remember feeling happy once though. I was at home, had just gotten out of the shower, and felt for the first time (that I could remember, anyway) what I thought was happiness, and none of the darkness. It lasted about 15 minutes but I talked about it a lot with both my therapist and my psychiatrist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your girlfriend sounds pretty great too. A good imagination is pretty great and an awesome trait in a partner. I feel bad sometimes because it&amp;#39;s hard for me to imagine things, and it bums my girlfriend a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where do you reddit? :-D&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "name": "t1_dbvtib4", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5lhuvl/hi_there_anyone_want_to_just_talk_with_me/dbvtib4/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483342871.0, "author_flair_text": "", "created_utc": 1483314071.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbvt069", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Pizzacanzone", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5lhuvl", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Hello mr_andrew!
