This isn&amp;#39;t the only factor as to why I&amp;#39;m depressed and considering suicide, however.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, without revealing too much personal information, my parents are very old- retirement age, and due to a combination of that and previous life events, I have lived for almost all my life (since I was around 2) in a (again, not naming any names) somewhat remote area of a third-world country. My parents love it here, but I don&amp;#39;t. My parents are so utterly attached to this place that they rarely even travel anymore, and as such I have seen very little outside of this one country. My lifestyle and personality fits living in a large, developed city in a developed country (such as my home country), so I am very unhappy with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More to the point, however, my parents have a personality that has damaged me. While they&amp;#39;re not conspiracy or pseudoscience nuts or anything like that, they&amp;#39;re excessively proud of me for any minor accomplishment and constantly convince me that I am the best person in the world and brag about me, even though I know that even with being in upper education I haven&amp;#39;t accomplished much. My work is extremely easy- I never feel challenged or stressed, and I don&amp;#39;t feel like I&amp;#39;ve learned much- this is only partially related, but I will be graduating in spring of next year.\nEven though I know it&amp;#39;s not true, my parents&amp;#39; overbearing proudness has had a severe impact on my own personality. As you might have gathered by the fact that I know nobody in real life and am posting on Reddit, almost all of my social interaction is online. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For over a year I have been the leader of a specific online group, which is almost the entire extent of my social interaction. Since it is one of the only examples of social interaction for me, I&amp;#39;ll use it to demonstrate how recently my personality has changed for the worse. I&amp;#39;m, to put it bluntly, a huge asshole, both online and off. I&amp;#39;m entitled, can&amp;#39;t handle jealousy at all and throw huge fits when it occurs, and I have no respect for the emotions of other people. My parents are becoming increasingly displeased with my behavior, and the people I know online are starting to greatly lose respect for me, even though I&amp;#39;ve known several of them for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next factor is that I believe that I may have autism or a similar disorder. This is not a hard fact. I have not been professionally diagnosed and due to my situation and location there aren&amp;#39;t currently any opportunities for me to be diagnosed. While I don&amp;#39;t want to say some BS about being &amp;quot;self-diagnosed&amp;quot;, my personality quirks, lack of social ability in real life even when presented with opportunities, and mannerisms (like stimming) seem to point to me having some sort of disorder, even if it&amp;#39;s not necessarily autism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, I have had several problems online in the past. I have done several things online (would rather not elaborate as my personal info is easily traceable) that have lead to my parents&amp;#39; personal and contact info being easily exposed with people who may be inclined to use them against me still out there, and as such I&amp;#39;m very paranoid. Several times in the past, contact info of my parents has been used against me and due to my recent behavior in real life matching up with my recent online behavior, I fear that if it happens again, my Internet access will be completely cut off except for school purposes, which would be hell since I spend nearly 24-7 (literally: it&amp;#39;s around 11 PM as I type this, and I have an odd sleep schedule) online browsing Reddit, watching YouTube, reading about things I&amp;#39;m interested in, and interacting with other people. If my internet access was taken away, I would probably do it right then and there and kill myself, since my life would have literally no meaning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another personality flaw of mine is that I get, for lack of a better word, &amp;quot;triggered&amp;quot; by anything I can&amp;#39;t do/have, a good example being that one of the people I know online is dedicated to drawing and art, which I have repeatedly tried and failed at with no motivation to continue, so I have tried to instate censorship of him and anyone else who&amp;#39;s into drawing, which obviously hasn&amp;#39;t made me very popular. This isn&amp;#39;t just a single example, I have this reaction to a number of other things as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to a combination of all these factors, I have rarely in my entire life interacted with other people in real life, and when I do get an opportunity (very very rare) it usually fails. To tell the truth, before I got involved in higher education, I was in school in this country, for 2 grades. (grade 1 and 2) The school system in this country is horrible, and my inexperience with the language and culture (at the time), plus my possible mental disorder and the fact that I was racially targeted by the other kids (I am as white as it gets, and I live in a country that doesn&amp;#39;t exactly fit those standards... I hate SJWs for this reason) caused me to hate it, even though I was getting social interaction. I eventually became homeschooled (despite the stereotype, my parents are not religious, for the record) and later entered higher education.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A common threat by my parents is to send me back to school- while this would seem like a good thing since I&amp;#39;d get social interaction, I know from before that it&amp;#39;s not since I had a very hard time coping in the environment, and the system in this country is just garbage (even more so than in America, although that&amp;#39;s not my home country). It would be easier for me now since I have a better grasp on the language and have matured somewhat (I used to do things like shout random phrases in the middle of class, or steal other classmates&amp;#39; things). My bad experiences in school have been my only proper social interaction with children my age for years- all my other real life human interaction is with adult friends of my parents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I want to live in a developed country (such as my home country) and go to school there, I&amp;#39;m still not so sure that would work out- I have no social skills, and I think (trying to not be too overt since I haven&amp;#39;t been professionally diagnosed) I have a disorder that is also impairing me. As such, I wouldn&amp;#39;t really do well anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The final factor is that I am extremely sheltered, mainly automatically because of my location and the personality of my parents. I have never been outside my house without one of my parents (not by rule- it&amp;#39;s just that due to my unfortunate location I literally can&amp;#39;t go anywhere alone since everything has to be reached via car) and, more to the point, I lack several basic life skills, such as housecleaning and how to tie my shoes (just an odd random example of a thing I&amp;#39;ve never been able to learn). Since I have a glimpse at &amp;quot;proper&amp;quot; life via the people I know online, I know that no part of my situation is normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to a combination of all of these factors, I&amp;#39;m depressed since I know I&amp;#39;ll never get proper social interaction due to my inexperience, lack of opportunities, and possible mental condition, I feel horrible since I&amp;#39;m basically a lazy asshole in terms of personality and I&amp;#39;ve been unable to fix it, my parents keep telling me that I&amp;#39;m perfect, I live in constant paranoia of my online life being taken away, and I hate where I live but will never get a chance to move away until I&amp;#39;m 18 or so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m considering suicide for these reasons- I&amp;#39;m not religious, but I just hope that somehow I get &amp;quot;reincarnated&amp;quot; as a normal person in a better country, or if not that I can just stop being so paranoid and depressed. I feel like I&amp;#39;m never going to get any proper social experience after having been deprived of it for so long, and I&amp;#39;m forever going to live with that stupid basically fake &amp;quot;child prodigy&amp;quot; label that will make people admire and over-expect me (I can&amp;#39;t perform miracles, nor can I do typical &amp;quot;smart people stuff&amp;quot; like do complex math in my head or at all) unless I just end it all now. And it&amp;#39;s not like it will just end when I graduate next year- I&amp;#39;m continuing for the next degree up (not providing specifics) so I&amp;#39;ll have to live under this fake label for even longer, then I&amp;#39;ll be thrust into making adult decisions at an unnecessarily young age. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also an only child (effectively- I have many brothers and sisters, all of which are much older and live in my home country) and as a result I&amp;#39;m just lonely and depressed in general with nobody in my own life to talk to, being forced into the worst possible combination for social interaction (no opportunities + no experience + possible mental disorder). In general, I just want to end it now and stop everything because I can&amp;#39;t just fix it. Being a prodigy doesn&amp;#39;t make me special- it just causes people to expect too much of me, and I don&amp;#39;t feel like I deserve the label. I just want to stop and fix everything all at once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, because I know people are going to say it, &amp;quot;Why don&amp;#39;t you talk to your parents about your situation?&amp;quot; there are a number of reasons. First of all, due to the previous incidents, I can&amp;#39;t talk about the online portion of events at all, which is a big deal since it&amp;#39;s my only social interaction (they don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m involved with anyone online anymore and just research stuff and watch YouTube all day, which isn&amp;#39;t true), and I simply feel physically unable to talk about certain subjects with my parents, including this (others include politics and such, there are some things that even if benign I just can&amp;#39;t get the &amp;quot;courage&amp;quot; to tell my parents). I need your help, &lt;a href=\"/r/suicidewatch\"&gt;/r/suicidewatch&lt;/a&gt;, as to what to do next. I don&amp;#39;t want to kill myself, but I fear it&amp;#39;s the only way to fix it all before it just gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Okay, so there's a lot of background info to this one.\n\nI'm (trying to not sound too /r/iamverysmart here) what would be considered as a child prodigy- I'm trying to give as few personal or identifying details as possible in this post, but I'm just going to say that I am currently in higher education, via the Internet, and I am a person in the age bracket of 10-14 (I'm trying to be as non-specific as possible here, since I don't want this to be possibly tracked down).\n\nSince my education is higher education over the Internet, you probably inferred that I have little human interaction in real life, as with most people in a similar situation to me (I assume).

For a 10-14 year old person, I feel a lot more optimistic about this approach than if you were 40 or even 20.\n\nOne of your primary causes of depression seems to be the fear that you'll be a rude, inconsiderate or petty person forever. Maybe you are aware of your precociousness in other areas and expect to be similarly mature socially too. I myself am not really astonished by your description of your behaviour, all things considered. I wonder if that online community you run is mostly composed of adults. If so, it is, honestly, even less surprising if you have ended up unpopular among them. (Do they know about your circumstances?)\n\nI wonder if it's the same kind of thing going on with your jealousy about drawing ability. At least when I was something of a \"child prodigy\" myself (way smarter overall than the average child my age, I don't dare say anything more than that), I got intensely jealous of anyone who was superior to me in some subject (especially of you, had you been there!). You haven't specified what your talents are in exactly, but I gather that it's at least verbal skills, introspection and expression, and language learning if you're not a native English speaker.\n\nOkay, so although I spent most of the day thinking about this, I'm not exactly a prodigy in writing down my thoughts in due time. I'll finish for now with what I thought was an important point: you express how you have a lot of uncertainty about your social role and social abilities as a result of your sheltered environment and lack of touch with the rest of them. I don't know if you 1) have a desire to be like them, and to fit in, or 2) just not be socially crippled. In the case of 1): I have only a smartass answer that others mentioned too - nobody is \"like them\"! In the case of 2): The rest of your teenage years and first half of your twenties (and to a lesser extent, the rest of you life after that) are going to give you a lot more \"shrewdness\" than anything a person would be expected to learn by the age of 14. At least, I have had that experience. If you ask me, there is such a thing as social shrewdness that can compensate for lack of practical skills. At least as far as interpersonal relations go - making and keeping friends of people you want to be friends with, and supposing you don't consider it more important to be the life of the party or dominate conversations or even manage them fluidly.\n\nIf I may peg my experience again, then so far, it sounds like you're in a similar situation as I was at your age, since I didn't associate and barely talked with people in my class until age 20 and worried that I'd be like an ant with no sense of smell for the pheromone trails, as goes the comparison some aspie on Reddit made. Instead I found that my complete lack of social experience didn't seem make me miss out on much (or maybe it did, and I'm still a complete fool and haven't realized it).\n\nA third concern that I think I sense is that you have no \"roadmap\" for your situation, \"culturally homeless\" as I've taken to calling it, since you are unique in your situation in your entire reference group and in the whole world according to your experience so far. This is a difficult point to nail down because feeling very different from the others causes unease in a thousand little ways in everyday life, as you realize that some advice doesn't apply to you or you don't feel the same reaction to something as you are expected to, for example. In this respect, I admit that others have it easier, and that it probably always is harder for prodigies.\n\nAs far as talking with your parents goes, it would at least escalate the situation, and make them realize that something is seriously wrong in their treatment of you if you're considering suicide, as long as they aren't totally unreasonable.
