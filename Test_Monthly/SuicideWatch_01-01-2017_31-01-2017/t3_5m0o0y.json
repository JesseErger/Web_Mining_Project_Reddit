I&amp;#39;ve tried to kill myself 2 times, the first being just 19 and second time 23. I don&amp;#39;t know really what to write or why I am really writing, as it won&amp;#39;t change my mind. Maybe just as something to get my feelings out. People tell me i&amp;#39;m a good person and I&amp;#39;m likeable, but it&amp;#39;s hard to believe someone when you dont like yourself. People don&amp;#39;t know much about my sadistic side or how much i want to inflict pain and lash out for all the things that have happened to me or what I&amp;#39;ve been given. I killed my neighbors cat last night. I haven&amp;#39;t felt that much power and intense feeling in years. I know it&amp;#39;s wrong, and i should feel guilty, but that&amp;#39;s just if I&amp;#39;m caught. I&amp;#39;ve shown signs in childhood i could be a serial killer. I couldn&amp;#39;t ever kill people thpugh, because I know I would do something stupid to get caught.\nI was abused physically, verbally, and emotionally. I dont really want to hurt people, but i am always angry. I&amp;#39;ve become petty and hateful of peoples happiness, especially on social media (facebook). I know i will never live a normal happy life like other people. I&amp;#39;ll never truly be loved or love, get married, have children, own a house. I&amp;#39;m also unsure of my sexuality. I guess i would say I&amp;#39;m a pansexual (which in my opinion sounds fucking stupid i prefer free lover), but I&amp;#39;ve never dated a guy out of fear of being ostracized. I&amp;#39;ve been in therapy and I never found it useful. I&amp;#39;ve grown to be angry at women for hurting me, using me, cheating, and lying. I know not all women are like that, but just the ones who were interested in me. I&amp;#39;m a funny guy and some would say attractive, but I dont believe that I am. But short (not just in height if you get my drift), not entirely socially bright, very low self esteem and confidence. Again, people tell me I&amp;#39;m a good person, but i dont believe that. How can i be good with such evil thoughts and actions. I&amp;#39;m no sociopath or psychopath, i feel, you could say too much if that makes sense, but i can be extremely apathetic \nEspecially towards death. I never thought of myself as an intelligent person even if people think I am. I just read and always have had an eagerness to learn. I&amp;#39;m a little bit of a nerd. I&amp;#39;ve been called a geek, a dork as well. I was never bullied and always had a few close friends never more than 3. Now i have no friends and don&amp;#39;t talk to anyone besides my parents and people I work with. I hate my job. I work at starbucks which is funny because I dont drink coffee and never went there befire i worked there. Let me tell you\nWorking customer service in a rich area at a starbucks can turn you into a psychopath. I dream about coming to work with an ak47 and gunning thise assholes down, but its just a fantasy, ya know? I&amp;#39;d rather blow my own brains out behind the counter.\nI know people will tell me get another job or finish school. School is not for me and hasn&amp;#39;t been after high school. I struggle with math, ive failed 4 math courses in school in 6 years and Need 1 more to get my associates degree. Ill get it this semester starting soon. It will make seeing people getting married and having children easier, but it won&amp;#39;t stop me from my ultimate goal of snuffing my blip of a life. I mean nothing and I have no effect on this universe, so it won&amp;#39;t miss me. I&amp;#39;ll be another statistic.  I could keep writing forever, but it wouldn&amp;#39;t been enough. I feel like I&amp;#39;ve said what I needed to say. Call me what you want. I know I&amp;#39;m a coward, that&amp;#39;s something I know for sure, but I&amp;#39;ll bever be sure that I&amp;#39;m a good person. I know I&amp;#39;m sick, and problably need help, but I dont know if I even want it. Death sounds so peaceful and nothingness sounds better than this world of idiots like trump running our world and people flaunting their happiness in your miserable face.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "My name is alex, and I'm a 24 years old male and I'm completely lost in this world.
