I know it might be more difficult given the circumstances, but probably even moreso now is it important to maintain your social ties, even if it's a little a day/week/whatever, where maybe you could just take time off from your troubles and listen to how they are doing or whatever, and maybe by doing that they will want to reciprocate and give you an opportunity to bring your situation up if you want and maybe that would be another form of support.\n\n\nBut the agenda primarily is to just stay in contact and know that you have that and can give you a break just to enjoy the people in your life and they can enjoy you, because maybe it'd be nice not just for you but for them to hear from you too, you know?\n\n\n\nBut yeah, you seem to be doing what you can, you're not just mooching or whatever, so there is no shame in that.
