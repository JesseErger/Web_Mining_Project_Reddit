Sometimes with my depression and my suicidal ideation and nihilism I have trouble sympathizing with people but I could feel how trapped you feel. I may not be able to give the best advice or a professional opinion but I can only tell you what I would want to do if I were in that situation.  I honestly would get out of there.  You don't have any time to yourself to get better.  You need to focus on YOU.  If you don't, your kids will grow up without a mom.  You mentioned worrying about scarring your kids if you continue to treat them this way, but what about the scarring that will occur if they grow up in this world without a mom?  I grew up without a father and I'm fucked up.  I spent 28 years of my life never admitting or thinking that growing up without a father figure really impacted me at all.  But it totally did.  I would much rather have my father in my life, even if he wasn't with my mother, or even if it's every once in awhile.  I'd much rather have a distant relationship with my father than have him be dead.  Leave for yourself now, work on yourself, and stay alive for them.  Your oldest is 3, he won't even remember if you took longer vacation to calm down.  And your husband?  Everyone can have great qualities but if he is incapable of supporting you emotionally at the moment, then he goes on the list of \"things that I don't need to think about right now\".  You only need to think about your mental health.  Maybe you taking a break and working on yourself is just the thing to get his lazy ass off the couch and do something around the house for once.  Get him to get the kids ready, to clean, to cook, to do laundry.  He would have time for his tv or his phone.  That may make him snap out of it.  Again, take some time for yourself and you can come back to things later with a clear mind.  Hell, your husband isn't going anywhere, you've been together for 18 years.  That's what I think.  If you can financially leave to be on your own for a bit while you calm down and find balance in your mind and soul, you should do it.  Even if that means coming back to your kids as either their fathers wife or friend, you will always be their mother.
