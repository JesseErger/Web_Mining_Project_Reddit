But speaking of meds, that was the big thing to go wrong this week. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went about my business the other day. First to my therapy appointment, where I mentioned that some of my meds ran out that day, and then a relative who happened to be going in the direction of the pharmacy picked them up for me and dropped them off. I take a look, and there was a mistake. I was supposed to fill my two antidepressants, Effexor and Zoloft  that day. Instead I got a new higher dose of Lithium, and half my normal dose of Effexor and no Zoloft. I figured they just screwed something up. So I call Mental Health and my therapist tells me she has a note from the NP saying she was cutting my Effexor and raising my Lithium, and nothing about the Zoloft. She did all this without consulting with me first, and without, obviously, even bothering to look at my file recently or she would&amp;#39;ve seen I&amp;#39;ve been non-stop depressed and not at all manic, not even hypomanic, not even close! At the same time, I had just asked to have my Zoloft switched to Lexapro which is stronger, and to have my Effexor raised, not lowered! But she told my therapist that she &amp;quot;wasn&amp;#39;t comfortable doing that without meeting with me first&amp;quot;, but she has NO QUALMS at all about lowering doses and raising my Lithium without talking to me first! Apparently, the Zoloft wasn&amp;#39;t up to be filled for a few more days, which is mysterious because I filled it the same day as my Effexor because I don&amp;#39;t have car, and I can&amp;#39;t be making a multitude of trips to the pharmacy. And then, I&amp;#39;m told I&amp;#39;m not supposed to meet with the NP until the end of February! Meanwhile I&amp;#39;m telling my therapist every time I see her that I&amp;#39;m extremely depressed and very suicidal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, I got my Zoloft filled and I told my therapist I&amp;#39;m doubling up on my Effexor until she fixes this, because it&amp;#39;s really bullshit. My therapist moved the appointment to next week and said we&amp;#39;ll all meet together because she agrees I&amp;#39;m not having problems with being too up, way way the opposite in fact.

How can I trust they won&amp;#39;t leave me high and dry because of a holiday or a weekend? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact is, I just can&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;m so screwed up now. I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s the fact that I just went three days without my Zoloft or I&amp;#39;m just not yet used to the higher Lithium dose, or if it&amp;#39;s just the broken trust, or if I&amp;#39;m just really this depressed. Whatever it is, I feel like I just want to hurt myself. 2016 was the stupidest year, it was just fucking awful. I want to kill myself. I don&amp;#39;t want to deal with anymore anything. I can&amp;#39;t deal the endless problems with my family, endless problems with my landlord, endless problems with finding work as a photographer in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, endless problems with exgfs, endless problems with being Bipolar, endless problems with just plain being miserable and alone, endless problems with my meds, endless problems with doctors and appointments and rides, endless problems my health, my whole life is endless problems one after another after another after another.

She agreed grudgingly to change it back and I also asked her to switch my Zoloft for Lexapro, but insurers don't like paying for Lexapro so we compromised by going with Celexa which is almost the same exact med. So I'm now tapering off Zoloft and on to Celexa. Also my Lithium was upped again to 1'200mg a day. So I got all that I wanted and then some. I'm okay with Celexa. \n\nIt's too early to tell how the new med combo is going to work but I'm keeping hopeful. My NP really doesn't like me being on two antidepressants. She's seemingly uncomfortable with it. But my problems are happening in the other direction. I'm not becoming manic, I'm stuck in depression land for God knows how much longer. All I'm sure about is that I haven't been hypomanic since June and that isn't changing. My ups these days are barely baseline. I feel so empty inside it's not a feeling I like. \n\nBut I have recognized something about myself; even if I find the perfect med combination, I'm still not going to be happy. The fact is, I'm just plain not happy with my life. I'm lonely and alone, I'm unhappy with my living conditions, I'm unhappy about being jobless. Really though I'm most unhappy about being so alone, I need a woman in my life. I'm terrible at the meeting them part, I'm always shy at first, but once I've gotten to know a girl I like, I'm pretty good at expressing that and everything else. But for now, I'm alone and it's making me miserable. Meds aren't going to fix that. But they might help me to reach a baseline so I can bring myself to get out there and meet new people. But it's never going to happen where I live. I can throw a rock in either direction and hit both ends of town. So I have to bring myself to leave town once in a while. \n\nSo I think I'm feeling positive about the new year. I hope you are as well. I've come to realizations that might help me to create the conditions I need to find happiness. That's a big step forward from last month, even if it may be a while before I see and feel the results. I do feel like with the new year comes new opportunities. That's all I could really have asked for.

Like I said in the post, I doubled up on my Effexor till I met with my Nurse Practitioner, and I said I didn&amp;#39;t agree to this, change it back or I&amp;#39;ll find someone who will. She agreed grudgingly to change it back and I also asked her to switch my Zoloft for Lexapro, but insurers don&amp;#39;t like paying for Lexapro so we compromised by going with Celexa which is almost the same exact med. So I&amp;#39;m now tapering off Zoloft and on to Celexa. Also my Lithium was upped again to 1&amp;#39;200mg a day. So I got all that I wanted and then some. I&amp;#39;m okay with Celexa. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s too early to tell how the new med combo is going to work but I&amp;#39;m keeping hopeful. My NP really doesn&amp;#39;t like me being on two antidepressants. She&amp;#39;s seemingly uncomfortable with it. But my problems are happening in the other direction. I&amp;#39;m not becoming manic, I&amp;#39;m stuck in depression land for God knows how much longer. All I&amp;#39;m sure about is that I haven&amp;#39;t been hypomanic since June and that isn&amp;#39;t changing. My ups these days are barely baseline. I feel so empty inside it&amp;#39;s not a feeling I like. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I have recognized something about myself; even if I find the perfect med combination, I&amp;#39;m still not going to be happy. The fact is, I&amp;#39;m just plain not happy with my life. I&amp;#39;m lonely and alone, I&amp;#39;m unhappy with my living conditions, I&amp;#39;m unhappy about being jobless. Really though I&amp;#39;m most unhappy about being so alone, I need a woman in my life. I&amp;#39;m terrible at the meeting them part, I&amp;#39;m always shy at first, but once I&amp;#39;ve gotten to know a girl I like, I&amp;#39;m pretty good at expressing that and everything else. But for now, I&amp;#39;m alone and it&amp;#39;s making me miserable. Meds aren&amp;#39;t going to fix that. But they might help me to reach a baseline so I can bring myself to get out there and meet new people. But it&amp;#39;s never going to happen where I live. I can throw a rock in either direction and hit both ends of town. So I have to bring myself to leave town once in a while. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I think I&amp;#39;m feeling positive about the new year. I hope you are as well. I&amp;#39;ve come to realizations that might help me to create the conditions I need to find happiness. That&amp;#39;s a big step forward from last month, even if it may be a while before I see and feel the results. I do feel like with the new year comes new opportunities. That&amp;#39;s all I could really have asked for. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "name": "t1_dc8dy8r", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5lduil/problems_at_mental_health_and_preparing_for_my/dc8dy8r/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1484057472.0, "author_flair_text": "", "created_utc": 1484028672.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}]
