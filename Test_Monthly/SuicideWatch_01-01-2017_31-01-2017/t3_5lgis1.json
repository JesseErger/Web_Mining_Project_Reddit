What will you do then?\n\nDoes jumping in front of a train still sound like a good idea? I wouldn't risk it. Many, many people live after throwing themselves in front of a train. Some do end up paralyzed because of it.\n\nI think maybe you haven't thought this through. I think if you were handed another option, one that involves living, but living without all the emotional pain, that you would take it.\n\nThe fact that you are angry with these psychologists suggests that you want help. It sounds like you are in a city. If that's true, you know that you can find another psychologist. Approach with this idea, this intention: \"I don't want to have to feel like I should kill myself.\" That is your goal. That and only that. Before you get anywhere else, you need to get to a place where you do not actively want to die.\n\nTogether, with the right psychologist, you can find out exactly what you need to do to get yourself there. It exists. Even the most suicidal have experienced it: that year or week or day or moment where you WANTED, absolutely WANTED to live. You're capable of returning to it. You just need help finding the path to it.
