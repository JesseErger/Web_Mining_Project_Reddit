Then i got to know a nice girl from the other class, she was nice to me, I was nice to her. After the trip we did alot and she was always nice to me. Then there was a city festival, we did drink together and i had her on my back because she had sore legs. This did continue for some months, i introduced her to some of my friends, especially to one friend, lets call him Tim. Tim was one of my best friends we also did alot as 3 people and after 3 weeks the girl texts me &amp;quot;Hey &lt;em&gt;Flannister1234&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#39;re really nice and really kind, but just as a friend&amp;quot; I said &amp;quot;Hmm okay&amp;quot; And we awkwardly kept being friends..
