After that my life became all about improving my skills as a programmer, and coming up with a successful project that I could maintain forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2000 I quit high school to pursue a career as a programmer.  The first months weren&amp;#39;t easy, but I found an employer willing to pay minimum wage and let me learn on the job, then in 2004 I found another job earning a much more comfortable salary and left home, which was the biggest achievement in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a self-taught programmer I used to learn by cloning existing software.  However and despite having worked on numerous projects I didn&amp;#39;t identify with anything in particular, and the only thing that I released to the public was a big patch to the Linux kernel which made it run on a specific PDA in 2005, but getting seriously involved in kernel development was not an aspiration that I had since I wanted to lead a large project of my own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In May 2008 I made the mistake of caving in to my friends&amp;#39; invitations and joined World of Warcraft.  At the time The Burning Crusade was in its last 6 months and I absolutely loved it, then Wrath of the Lich King came out and I didn&amp;#39;t like what some of the changes did to the community, so I wrote two add-ons to assist those who felt like me and kept playing the game until November 2010, when Cataclysm was released with even more changes that I didn&amp;#39;t like.  I never achieved anything meaningful in the game as I hated the end-game drama, but even though I didn&amp;#39;t have the burden of raiding in my life, all the time that I didn&amp;#39;t spend playing the game was spent in the community forums, and I almost got fired for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After quitting World of Warcraft I didn&amp;#39;t return immediately back to coding as I felt that I had lost the passion, and since my job mostly as a web back-end developer didn&amp;#39;t require me to learn more than what I knew. there was no motivation to continue learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In September 2011 I started to notice that my vision was dimming and losing contrast, but since doctors told me that the only problem with my good eye was a cataract and that I should wait until I couldn&amp;#39;t see anything before getting it removed because it was a risky surgery I didn&amp;#39;t think much about it.  By November my vision had deteriorated so much that I could barely read black text on a white background both in print and on the screen, so I decided to quit my job and wait a year before having the cataract removed as I had saved enough money to afford not working for that long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By March 2013 I was running out of money without any employment perspectives due to my failing vision but didn&amp;#39;t want to risk having the surgery yet, so I decided to move back to live with my family to save money and started to think about projects from which I could both learn and, in the long run, make some money.  I turned to the mobile platforms but couldn&amp;#39;t think of anything interesting, until one day I found the original Dungeon Keeper CD and thought to myself that it was an amazing game for me to clone to the mobile platforms as it didn&amp;#39;t require a lot of artwork, and since I wanted to learn, I had to write my own game engine.  This could also be the large project that I have always looked for.  My problem with games was the fact that I&amp;#39;m not an artist, so I&amp;#39;d have to hire them to work with me, but I was confident that if I developed the game enough I&amp;#39;d be able to hire talent here on reddit to help me with the models, textures, sound effects, music, level design, etc..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In March 2014 I finally decided to have my cataract removed because I got hit by a train after falling to the track as my contrast perception was already so low that I couldn&amp;#39;t even distinguish the edge of the platform,, but unfortunately after the cataract was removed my vision didn&amp;#39;t return, and the little vision that I had was gone as I was left seeing everything extremely blurry, so I guess the surgery went wrong.  It turned out that my optic nerve was getting damaged all along, but my intra-ocular pressure was always at an acceptable level in the doctor&amp;#39;s office, and they couldn&amp;#39;t see the damage through an ophthalmoscope because my pupils don&amp;#39;t dilate due to a surgery that I had to lower the pressure when I was born.  Since then I&amp;#39;ve been seeing a psychiatrist who tells me that I&amp;#39;m not depressed but have a &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder\"&gt;schizoid personality disorder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nowadays I keep daydreaming about either killing myself or implementing my game engine, only one of which is still possible.
