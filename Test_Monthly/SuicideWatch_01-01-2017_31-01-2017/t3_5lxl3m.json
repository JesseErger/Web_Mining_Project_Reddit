I want to feel the strength of my body fade away and finally deplete entirely. I always wanted to be an astronomer, ever since I was a kid. I always thought outside of regularities, thus I wanted to know more about what lit up the night sky. But that irrational thinking ruined me. My grades plummeted.

My mom took away my confidence to cut. She made me feel humiliated when she discovered what I&amp;#39;d done to my arms. I&amp;#39;m only draining my family of money anyway. 40 dollars for one therapy session and prescription antidepressants are probably wrecking our bank account. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to continue anymore.

Always there through those nights that I wanted to end everything. But now I have absolutely no one. Not one friend in the world. Sure, I&amp;#39;ve got family. But it&amp;#39;s not a good one. Always working. Disabled. There was no one to raise me other than my grandmother, but where do you think she is now? Right!
