Well growing up I always was an outcast people would ignore me as well as my mom dad and sister they always were to busy to pay attention to me kids at school wouldn't pick on me to say because I was a pretty big kid not fat but taller then everyone else big wide shoulders always made me look like I was bigger and scary anyways what I'm trying to say is I was alone all the way up to 18 and had thoughts of suicide but then I met her the love of my life the one I always wanted to be with and I was the one she picked to fall madly in love with for three years we had a perfect relationship well I guess that's wrong wording we had a good relationship some fighting here and there but nothing ever serious we liked the same things and hated the same things we joked played games went for walks had many dates always fighting over who would pay always ended up me paying lol but we were inseparable but anyways we ended up having a child together well I didn't take that to good I was scared and I reacted wrong asking about the options to end the pregnancy well she didn't take that to well and there you have it I was single sad depressed and alone again then the suicide thoughts started happened again the thoughts that were always there but I was able to mange with her being there for me then that's when the first attempt happened I got drunk and grabed a knife and just as I started sliding the knife across my throat the phone rang drunk me answered it and it a person who was helping me to find housing because we had a place together me and her forgot to mention that but anyways he could tell something was off and called 911 on me the police came made me throw away the knife took me to the hospital and that's when the meds started coming easy access right couple overdose attempts but was never enough to kill me and that one drowning attempt was in the hospital then I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder bpd for short with anxiety and depression I was 19 at the time so think about it all my life growing up until 19 never got help from anyone for my mental illness but her anyways let's continue with the story my now pregnant ex found out about the attempts by my mother hoping she could help me because my mother didn't know what else to do with me being through the five attempts with me so me and my ex started talking again was going well three months later we were back together I followed her down to where her parents lived everything was going great again we had our beautiful daughter we didn't live together but were always with each other and stayed over night at our places fast forward to four months later everything was going good our baby was healthly then I didn't feel so well the suicide thoughts came and hit me full force but I found my way to the hospital once I got out I received a text from her saying \"we both want different things\" I didn't understand I tried to talk to her but she didn't want to talk and there was no hope of getting back together that was three weeks ago went from good to bad in a snap of a finger I was kicked out of both her and my daughters life just like that I barely see her now because she is breast fed and the mother can't pump milk and back again I'm sad depressed alone and sucidal more then ever I tried to get back out there went on a couple dates but it didn't change anything the magic I had with her wasn't there with anyone else even though they liked me I tried talking to a professional about everything but the safety and support she gave me wasn't there I tried a handful of meds through out this whole thing and nothing seems to work I've gone to countless appointments for help by different people different things I've even tried a BPD group that's meant to teach you how to control the thoughts and emontions that everyone swears by but nothing seems to work I just feel past the point of help past the point of saving and past the point of ever feeling the same love I felt with her I don't even know why I'm writing this I guess its my story and my death note all that's left to say is I will not fail this time so\n\nGoodbye.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null,
