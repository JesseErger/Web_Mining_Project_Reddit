If you hold on you can slowly start making life better little by little. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want a significant other, then go out there and talk to people, don&amp;#39;t care if they&amp;#39;re a 8-10/10 physically, give a care about how they connect with you. About how they make you feel as a person when you&amp;#39;re with them. If you can spend 1hr with this person and it makes you feel like only 20mins have passed then you&amp;#39;re on the right track. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you hate your job, well welcome to the club, but also don&amp;#39;t forget that you&amp;#39;re not a slave to them, go out there with your best suit or dress on and hit those job applications hard. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is all easier said than done, but everything in life is like that. Push yourself everyday to do better, not for anyone, but for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t mind being a ghost or lonely, it&amp;#39;s better that way, while I&amp;#39;m accomplishing things, it&amp;#39;s better that no unwanted person notices. My girlfriend notices and she&amp;#39;s a hell of positive person and that&amp;#39;s all that matters. My negative individuals in my life that&amp;#39;s cool they don&amp;#39;t notice fuck them, let them keep being idiots. I don&amp;#39;t need their commentary on what I&amp;#39;m doing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember you hit rock bottom, what else is their left to do.....GO UP AND START CLIMBING OUT OF THE HOLE. Once you&amp;#39;re out, come visit this ghost he&amp;#39;ll have an open seat, a nice warm hug and a cold drink waiting for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "name": "t1_dbx9tai", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5lmepf/i_am_so_lonely/dbx9tai/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483432267.0, "author_flair_text": "", "created_utc": 1483403467.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qpzs", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lmepf", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": null, "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qpzs", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_5lmepf", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dbxk9ks", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "BeYouBeStrong", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dbxdpgs", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I know it's painful.
